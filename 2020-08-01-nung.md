More than **10 million people** worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease (PD). A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. Basically in simpler terms, Parkinson's disease is not curable but many patients have been suffering from it worldwide.

By addressing this crucial problem, I would like to propose a tech device that could help hospitals offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.

# Wearable tech device

I have decided to build a wearable tech device for PD patients from scratch. This wearable tech device could accurately capture PD patient's movement or vibration throughout the day. This feature is extremely important as it will show a recurring pattern of the patient's movement, for example the patient's movement will be slightly stiffer at night than in the morning.

Another benefit is to leverage the data collected. When PD patients see their doctors, they usually ask the doctor to adjust their medication based on the pattern they see from their body's symptoms throughout the day. But here is the problem, they will not recall every single detail, and here is when **the data speaks for itself**. By showing the doctor a summary of the past few months' pattern, doctors can now adjust the medications easier based on the data itself.

# Hardware

This is my first ever project that connects both hardware and software together. Primarilly, I'll be using an Arduino Uno to send the data to my computer server which will be running a program that draws a line graph live.

### Tools

- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- SW-420 (vibration sensor)
- Jumper wires

### Setup

# How?
The **SW-420** will capture the vibration data from the user. Based on the time of the day, it will show different number of the vibration.
