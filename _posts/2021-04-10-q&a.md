This is a special post as I am not writing any new content. As this week is Easter Break, I will be answering some questions I got lately from my readers.

## Q1: How and Why did you make this blog?

I always had the urge to make something and be original.

One of my favorite quote:

> Don't try to be the best, be the first. ~ Jack Ma

I felt a special resembalance with the quote. I was, still am never the best, in academics, sports, music, even my handwriting ✍️ etc. I never excell in any of them, average would be the right word.

Being the first brings me a lot more satisfaction as all it requires is your creativity and the dare to take risks. On the other hand, I don't even have competition as I'm the first.😂

Many people are curious how I created this weekly blog. I used `Jekyll`, a static site generator. Static sites use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to render the page. As I'm using a generator, all the difficult bits are being handled by `Jekyll`. So I just needed to focus on content and styling for my web page.

## Q2: What do you blog about?

There are no specific topics, but I usually blog about programming, updating my progress on certain projects or sometimes sharing some fun things that are happening around me, i.e. home schooling for current situation.

## Q3: What are your upcoming projects?

Currently, I have 4 projects including this blog. Which are 2 websites and 2 apps. Most of them are still developing, mainly debugging. I am still new to web and app development so sometimes it may take me 2 hours to debug, so I shift to different projects just to free my brain from thinking on that specific bug.
