From last week's blog, we introduced the front end design of the app. This week we will be going through the back end of the app.

# Part 1: Back End

As mentioned from last week's blog front end is basically the user side, what the user sees and interact. The back end is the opposite, it is the the database side.

# Part 2: Installations

## Tools

- MongoDB (This is the free database I am using, you can use something else)
- Mongoose (MongoDB framework)
- Express (A node framework)
- Node (Node links the database with your app)
- Axios (Links your frontend with the backend)

`npm i mongoose express axios --save`

# Part 3: Setting Up

Create a new folder that will run your backend server.

```
mkdir backend
cd backend
```

Then call git init and install all the dependencies (aka tools)

```
git init
npm i mongoose express axios --save
```

Create a new file called `server.js` and paste in this code.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

require("dotenv").config();

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const todoRouter = require("./routes/todo");

const url =
  <mongodb_url>
mongoose.connect(url, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});

const connection = mongoose.connection;
connection.once("open", () => {
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
});

app.use("/todos", todoRouter);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Server connected to: " + port);
});

```
