From last week's blog, we introduced the front end design of the app. This week we will be going through the back end of the app.

# Part 1: Back End

As mentioned from last week's blog, front end is basically the user side. What the user sees and interact. The back end is the opposite, it is the the database side. It stores all the user's data, the user won't see it which is why it's called **back** end.

# Part 2: Installations

## Tools

- MongoDB (This is a free database I am using)
- Mongoose (MongoDB framework)
- Express (Node framework)
- Node (Node links the database with your app)
- Nodemon (Node framework that auto updates the terminal once you saved your code)

`npm i mongoose nodemon express axios --save`

# Part 3: Setting Up

Create a new folder in the same todo app project as last week's.

```javascript
mkdir backend
cd backend
```

Then call git init and install all the dependencies.

```javascript
git init
npm i mongoose nodemon express axios --save
```

Create a new file called `server.js`. Create a port that will host your server. You can type in any number but I usually use port 5000.

```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Server connected to: " + port);
});
```

To test run, simply type `nodemon server` to your terminal

Replace the `<mongodb_url>` with your url, you can find it in the connect section once you created your cluster. This will connect your MongoDB to the app. _Quick tip: Use the free cluster when you are starting a new project in MongoDB_

```javascript
const url = <mongodb_url>
mongoose.connect(url, {
useNewUrlParser: true,
useCreateIndex: true,
useUnifiedTopology: true
});

const connection = mongoose.connection;
connection.once("open", () => {
console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
});

```

## Model

After setting up the server, we will create a **Model**. It will create objects to be declared, so basically columns that is used to locate and store the data.

```javascript
const TodoSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    status: { type: Boolean, required: true },
    date: { type: Date, required: true },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
  }
);
```

## Router

### Get Request

This will get all the available data that is saved into the database.

```javascript
router.route("/").get((req, res) => {
  Todo.find()
    .then((todos) => res.json(todos))
    .catch((err) => res.status(400).json("Errors: " + err));
});
```

### Post Request

This will send data to MongoDB once it is called. It will create a new todo row for the `newTodo`.

```javascript
router.route("/").post((req, res) => {
  const title = req.body.title;
  const description = req.body.description;
  const status = Boolean(req.body.status);
  const date = Date.parse(req.body.date);

  const newTodo = new Todo({
    title,
    description,
    status,
    date,
  });

  newTodo
    .save()
    .then(() => res.json("Todo added!"))
    .catch((err) => res.status(400).json("Errors: " + err));
});
```

## Testing

Testing is a very important step, as it determines whether your backend server and the MongoDB work. You need to install **Postman** in google web store. It is an extension. Then paste in your localhost (remember to add the url in your router behind the localhost).

Here is an example `http://localhost:5000/todos/`.

<img src="/img/todo/postman.png" alt="localhost" width="800">

Then click the **POST** button on the left and enter value in **body**. When you press submit, it should say `Todo Added`.

If you change the button to **GET** on the left hand side menu. When you press submit, it should say list out the todo you added before hand. In my case it would be 'Clean Room'.

Your Backend is Working.ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

# END

This blog gave you a simple tutorial on adding your backend to the existing Todo App. Next week we will look at how to connect frontend to backend.

I have put the full source code for this week's tutorial on **[Github](https://github.com/melaniehsieh/subtle)**. Good Luck!

Thanks for reading ðŸ‘€. There will be a weekly blog every Friday, Stay Tuned.ðŸ˜‰
