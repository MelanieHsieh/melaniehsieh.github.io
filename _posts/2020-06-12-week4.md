This week's been productive!

Throughout this 7 days, I have been working and improving the design basically the user interface or user experience of my website. Although previously I've already designed the mockup, but after a bit of research and a bit of experimenting with the color schemes, I've decided to redo my design. It was a big commitment as I basically redo the whole entire website, which took me around 4+ hours to finish it!

# THE DESIGN

Why did I bother to redesign and remake the website? Well, first of all layout and design of a product such as a website is extremenly important. Because many people including me **judge a book by its cover**. Let's be realistic when people see an aesthetically pleasing website, they will definitely click on it and explore around rather than just close the tab and move on.

Even though I don't take art, nor a professional designer, but I have common sense. I basically used my instinct to determine whether this page looks good or needed a few changes.

Enough talking...Here are a few screen shots of the website.

I used neumorphic design to spice up the original mockups. I added a few shadows to the corners making the buttons look more 3D. Clean and minimal are my first priorities. This could help the users maneuver over the website smoothly, removing some friction and hopefully making the website look professional so people won't notice a high schooler made this. But a 'designer' built this. ðŸ˜‚

By the way if you are curious on how I landed this design, I actually did a few googling and testing on Adobe XD before comitting 3+ hours to actually style them on my website.

_Feel free to comment below and give me some suggestions/advice on the design._

# Progress Update: Week 4 ðŸ“Š

Next week, it is back on the server side coding. I will be focusing on writing functions. Hopefully it could simplify my existing code and makes the application more scalable for the future.

### UX/UI Design âœ…

- Designed a minimal web layout and implemented it to the actual website.
