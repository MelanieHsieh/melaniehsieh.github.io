In _Decemeber 31st, 2019_ I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.

**Number ONE:** it's a new decade ðŸ”Ÿ. **2020** means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It's a year where I want to improve myself _exponentially_.

**Number TWO:** I turned 16. ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰

**Number THREE:** I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year.

# Covid-19 in Hong Kong

As I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 near the end of January, more than 100 countries are infected. which included Hong Kong. This made all the schools closed down and holiday extension. I am not complaninig about the extra few days of holidays, but not able to go outside freely sucks.

Wearing a mask is uncomfortable, makes my face sweaty as the air inside doesn't circulate properly. ðŸ˜· But wearing a mask is very important especially these days, as corona virus is deadly ðŸ¦ . So for your family, friends' health and safety, also other people in your neighborhood or community, I urge you to **wear a mask**.
