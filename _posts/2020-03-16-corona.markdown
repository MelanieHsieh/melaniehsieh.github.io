In _Decemeber 31st, 2019_ I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.

**Number ONE:** it's a new decade ðŸ”Ÿ. **2020** means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It's a year where I want to improve myself _exponentially_.

**Number TWO:** I turned 16. ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰

**Number THREE:** I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year.

I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 in the end of January, more than 100 countries are infected, including Hong Kong. Making schools closed and holidays extension. I am not blaming for an extra few days for holidays, but not able to go outside freely sucks...

I have been stuck at home for at least 1 month. Think about it, 1 month is quite a long period of time. Sitting in your room and zero interaction with your friends.
