In _Decemeber 31st, 2019_ I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.

**Number ONE:** it's a new decade ðŸ”Ÿ. **2020** means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It's a year where I want to improve myself _exponentially_.

**Number TWO:** I turned 16. ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰

**Number THREE:** I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year.

As I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 near the end of January, now more than 100 countries are infected, which obviously affected Hong Kong. This made all the schools closed and holiday extension. I am complaninig for the extra few days of holidays, but not able to go outside freely sucks.

Wearing a mask is uncomfortable, makes my face sweat as the air inside circulates, and hardly escapes. But wearing a mask is very important especially these days. So for the sake of your family, friends and other people in your neighborhood **wear a mask**.

I have been stuck at home for at least 1 month. Think about it, 1 month is quite a long period of time. Sitting in your room and zero interaction with your friends.
