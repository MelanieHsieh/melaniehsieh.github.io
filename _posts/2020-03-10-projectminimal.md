Starting 2020 off with a bang üéâ, even though I'm late to the game for 3 months but whatever. The purpose of this weekly blog (more like when I'm feeling writing mode blog üòÇ) is simple, I want to share my tips and tricks on programming and some day to day experiences.

As this is the first time I tried blogging, this is still an experimenting phrase, which means this website will change up quite often.

# WHY

As Melanie Hsieh once said:

> Every project must start with a **Why**.

_(I'm pretty sure someone famous said that, but since this is my blog I can say whatever I want.)_

My goal or **WHY** is to inspire other girls to pursue engineering or tech, pursue might not be the word but introducing them to _The Wonderful World of Technology_. The number of _Women in Tech_ üë©‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è is still low, and the future world defenitely needs more engineerer. So why not combine the two of them?

And this is why **Project Minimal** is created. I don't even know how I came up with this name but someday sometime somewhere it just pops up in my head so I'm sticking with my gut.

This is a simple minimal website (_you can see it from the title_) I decided to create to document my experience in tech and share my thoughts and feelings.

Establishing the `#projectminimal` community, the main purpose is to inspire others to get into technology engineer.
