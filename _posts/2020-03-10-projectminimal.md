Starting 2020 off with a bang 🎉, even though I'm late to the game for 3 months but whatever. The purpose of this weekly blog is simple, I want to share my tips and tricks on programming and some day to day experiences.

As this is the first time I tried blogging, it is still in experimenting phrase, which means this website will change often times.

# WHY

As Melanie Hsieh once said:

> Every project must start with a **Why**.

(I'm pretty sure someone famous said that, but since this is my blog I can say whatever I want. 😂)

My **WHY** is to inspire other girls to pursue engineering or tech, pursue might not be the word but introduce them to _The World of Technology_. The number of _Women in Tech_ 👩‍💻️ is still low, and the future world defenitely need more engineers. So why not combine the two together?

And this is why **Project Minimal** is created. (I don't even know how I came up with this name but someday sometime this name just poped up in my brain so I'm sticking with my gut.)

This is a minimal website which I decided to create to document my experiences in tech (coding/programming) and share my thoughts and feelings.

Establishing the `#projectminimal` community, the main purpose is to inspire others to get into technology.
