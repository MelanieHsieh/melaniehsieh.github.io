# Quick Updates

During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools ended early (but students still need to go to lessons online via Zoom). In April, starting this week, I have an Easter Break that lasts for 2 full weeks. Initially, it was meant to be a break so people can go outside and relax, but now everything seems to change. No one could go outside, go on vacations as most countries are in _lock-down mode_, hangout with friends. So the only option is to stay at home. During the break I continued on my project - Subtle, the Todo App.

# Bugs

This morning I was going on Instagram, and I saw a post about **Types of people during Quarantine**. There are a few that caught my eye, such as _the introverts_, _the freelancers_ and _the heros_. But then I thought about programmers/developers.

As a beginner programmer, the ONE THING that ruins my day is **BUG(s)**. They usually come in the color red, with a vague caption on the top that usually reads **TypeError: Cannot read proprety 'xxx' of undefined**. Let me show you how **BUGS** affect my daily mood. 😁😡

# Here is A Day in the Life of a Programmer (beginner version) :

1. 😁 - I run the code, it runs smoothly 👏(congrats)
2. 😁 - I start to add new features
3. 😡 - I run the code again and something red pops up.
4. 😡 - I google the bug, look at my code and do some corrections
5. 😡 - Continue **Step 5 and 6** over and over again until nothing red shows up, sometimes it might not be an error but the outcome isn't what I was expecting. On average it takes me 2 hours to debug one singe bug. (Quite time consuming...)
6. 😑 - If I can't debug the code, I usually do something else (i.e. Eat lunch, sleep, watch YouTube)
7. 😁 - Finally, I solved the bug
8. 😑 - I repeat the steps all over again

As you can see, my mood swings a lot. Quite drastically, from happy to mad, back to happy and back to mad. Often times I get demotivated as the code seems unsolvable. But I found a few tips and tricks to debug my code.

# 5 Ways to Debug your code

### 1. Use `console.log()`

- In javascript it's `console.log()`, in python it's `print`.
- It prints out the value of a variable you're declaring in the console
- It is an effective way to check your variables, methods, and function. Making sure they are working perfectly, if not it can also pinpoint the error.

### 2. Use Google

- Many programming languages have existed for a decade or longer, many problems you faced were also faced by many people
- Websites such as Stack Overflow, Github, MDN web docs (if you are using javascript) are great ways to find solutions for your bug

### 3. Go on Youtube

- On Youtube, you can find videos that teaches you how to code from scratch
- You can reference some of their codes to your project

### 4. Ask a friend

If you are like me who doesn't have friends that code, use online platforms.

- Discord, join public servers and ask questions. Many people in the server are more experienced than you.
- Reddit, post your question on specific categories or just search for similar bugs and see the responses.

### 5. Sleep

Many times, I take breaks in between just to relax my brain cells (kinda). For me the best thing is just to take a break. Often times I think of alternative ways to solve the bug or even different ways to get the final results.
