Week 3. Halfway through and 3 more weeks to go!

I am delighted to say I have successfully launched a new feature. **Categories algorithm**, this algorithm is the most difficult algorithm to code out of the other 2. I have been coding this particular section for a few weeks. Many times I was stucked in the infinie loop of bugs, but I am happy to announce the first version of Revenue, Expense, Categories algorithm is successfullly running. 👏👏

# Version 1.0 features

Version 1.0 is a bare bone framework and feature of Cashrithm. This will include 3 algorithms that sums up the data, categorize data based on Vender name and filter unecessary data value out based on the google sheet url which the user will input in a given input box.

However, this version is not scalable as the algorithm is only limited to a few data sheet, and the run time is quite slow. In order to make my life simplier and easier in the future, I have decided to convert them into functions. A function for summing up all the value of a given column, a function that categorize value based on the Vender name and many more. In the future, if I wanted to add new algorithms, I can just simply add a few lines of code and Voila the algorithm is running. 👍

From my self-taught coding journey, I've learned that **write once run anywhere** is a super important hack that could save me a ton of time.

# Version 1.1

Since Version 1.0 is the bare bone skeleton of the structure of the program, Version 1.1 should be the fun stuff that gets implemented. I'm still confused by the numbering of the versions, some have 3 digits. I'll just stick with 2 for now. 😂

In the next 3 weeks, I will be working on version 1.1. Hopefully improving the user experience when they go on my website. But I will also fix some bugs I've been avoiding lately (mainly because debugging is a stressful and boring process, let's hope in the future someone created a machine that could rewrite my code and make it bug-free).

I'm extremely excited, and hopefully the outcome after 6 weeks could wow myself as this is big milestone for me, personally. 🎯

# Progress Update: Week 3 📊

Next week, I will continue coding the input area where users can control what they want to see in the final summary sheet. On the other hand, I would convert all algorithms into functions that could be called easily.

### Algorithms ✅
