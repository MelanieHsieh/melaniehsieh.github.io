One of the project this year is to make a Todo App. If you search _todo app_ in the app store or play store there are a lot of options. However I tried a few of them, and often they are either too complicated to use, or they are just missing some functions I want. So this upcoming month, I am planning to launch my Todo App called **Subtle** from scratch.

# Part 1: Planning Phase

For the planning I used **Adobe XD** to help me finalize the design. Adobe XD is a free app that helps you design the **UI (User Interface)** of the app. 

Here are a few snap shots of my app (in planning phase). I am aiming for a minimalistic app, which is simple and clean.

After you finalize the UI of the app, let's move on to the code. ðŸ˜‰

# Part 2: Front End

When creating an app there is **Front End** and **Back End**. Front End is the client side, where it consists of *UI*, *color scheme*, *UX*. Back End is the database side, where it consists of *database*, *schemas*, *authentication* and many more.

We will start with the **Front End**.

## Tools
- React Native (A programming language developed by *Facebook*, it isn't a native language which means it doesn't use *Swift*, *Java* or *Kotlin*. But it uses *Javascript* and *Typescript* to build apps that are available for both IOS and Android devices ðŸ˜€ )
- VS Code (Code Editor, I want to switch to *Vim* but I don't have time to learn and install all the bundles and depencies, so I am sticking with VS Code)
- iTerm (Terminal)
