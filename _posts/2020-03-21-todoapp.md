One of the project this year is to make a Todo App. If you search _todo app_ in the app store or play store there are a lot of options. However I tried a few of them, and often they are either too complicated to use, or they are just missing some functions I want. So this upcoming month, I am planning to launch my Todo App called **Subtle** from scratch.

# Part 1: Planning Phase

For the planning I used **Adobe XD** to help me finalize the design. Adobe XD is a free app that helps you design the **UI (User Interface)** of the app.

Here are a few snap shots of my app (in planning phase). I am aiming for a minimalistic app, which is simple and clean.

After you finalize the UI of the app, let's move on to the code. ðŸ˜‰

# Part 2: Front End

When creating an app there is **Front End** and **Back End**. Front End is the client side, where it consists of _UI_, _color scheme_, _UX_. Back End is the database side, where it consists of _database_, _schemas_, _authentication_ and many more.

We will start with the **Front End**.

## Tools

- React Native (A programming language developed by _Facebook_, it isn't a native language which means it doesn't use _Swift_, _Java_ or _Kotlin_. But it uses _Javascript_ and _Typescript_ to build apps that are available for both IOS and Android devices ðŸ˜€ )
- VS Code (Code Editor, I want to switch to _Vim_ but I don't have time to learn and install all the bundles and depencies, so I am sticking with VS Code)
- iTerm (Terminal)

# Part 3: Setting Up

```javascript
npm install expo-cli --global
expo init newProject //your project name
cd newProject //your project name
expo start
```

I used expo to setup my project. Expo is a tool that can help you build a React Native app quickly, there is also an app (Expo) which you can install on your phone to render your app live.

## DoubleTap
I replaced the `TouchableOpacity` button with `DoubleTap`.

```javascript
function DoubleTapButton({ onDoubleTap, children }) {
  const onHandlerStateChange = ({ nativeEvent }) => {
    if (nativeEvent.state === State.ACTIVE) {
      onDoubleTap && onDoubleTap();
    }
  };

  return (
    <TapGestureHandler
      onHandlerStateChange={onHandlerStateChange}
      numberOfTaps={2}
    >
      {children}
    </TapGestureHandler>
  );
}
```
