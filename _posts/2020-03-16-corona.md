In _Decemeber 31st, 2019_ I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.

**Number ONE:** it's a new decade 🔟. **2020** means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It's a year where I want to improve myself _exponentially_.

**Number TWO:** I turned 16. 🎂🎉

**Number THREE:** I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year.

# Home School

I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 in the end of January, more than 100 countries are infected which includes Hong Kong. The New Year holiday was extended, so more holiday 😄. However after a short break from school, we students needed to go to school online. The good thing is I could wake up an hour late from my usual time, I wore my pajamas 💤 to lessons and I could eat whenever I want. This may sound nice but it's actually not.

I have been stuck at home for more than 1 month. 1 month may not seem like an overly long period of time, but having lessons at home and zero interaction with your friends makes me crave to go to school.

# Wash Your hands 🧼🖐️

I really do hope this **crisis** could end before Easter. Anyways, be safe remember to wash your hands and please visit the doctor if you start coughing because corona is really deadly...😵
