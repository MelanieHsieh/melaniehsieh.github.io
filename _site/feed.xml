Within the next 6 weeks, from 20th of May to 30th of June, I will be focusing on one project which is a website that tracks cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;stage-1-planning-phase&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Planning phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the first 2 days to plan out the week. Having a clear vision and purpose in the early stage can highly improve the effiency of the work flow, not only does it give clarity to the work I’m doing but it also motivates me to check off tasks from my list of todos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/design.png&quot; alt=&quot;design&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualize&quot;&gt;Visualize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to visualize the outcome and structure of the website. I created this framwork structure that clearly displays the bare bone of my website. From this skeleton framework, it shows how many pages are there on the website, how are they linked and which section needs access to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a visual person 👀. Before starting any project, I need to have a broad image of the product in my head. What are the key functions, what does it look like and what special features that makes the application interesting. Creating this design framework above, simply makes me visualize the image of the product clearer. Fun fact, I used different colors to represent different sections: blue = navigation bar, turquoise = algorithms, yellow = sheets etc, so it will look less boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-careful-not-to-get-stuck-in-the-planning-loop&quot;&gt;Be careful not to get stuck in the Planning Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people might want to have the perfect plan, however a perfect plan doesn’t exist in my case. Because I’m still a very inexperienced programmer who has been coding for the past 2 years only (sort of, took a few breaks in between).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning is important, but not the most important thing when needed to finish a project. I like to experiment with things. When I did some testing and researches on databases, it broadens my knowledge and view on them. Instead of planning every single step I much prefer experimenting and trying out new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;stage-2-start-building&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Start building&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After planning the broad looks and functions of the website, I began to code. First of all, I started adding components. A create new sheet page, login and signup pages for adding new users and a bit of styling to make the page more colorful. (Actually from the design framework above, all the rectangles which are filled in are finished, and the small squares on the top left are database. If I add those squares on specific component, it means they need access to the database.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today will be the end of 3rd day. I still have 4 days to go until the first week is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;here-is-my-plan-so-hear-me-out&quot;&gt;Here is my plan, so hear me out&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be adding a new component – tabs. This will allow the user to edit and add the name of each tab in the google spreadsheet to the platform. &lt;em&gt;If there’s extra time, I hope to sync the tabs to the database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be taking a break. Hopefully able to go on a hike with my mates if the weather is good, preferably sunny and windy day (opitimal hiking weather).☀️💨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a break is necessary, not only does it frees up your brain from all the clutter you have been stacking up from the week, but it is also good for your mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no work is getting done on Sunday. 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;, debugging time. When adding new features to my website I am pretty sure some unecessary issues and bugs will pop up. I like to leave myself a day or two just to check on the code to see if it runs smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get stressed when things bugs are popping up, especially when the deadline is closing by. So leaving extra time to double check just makes me feel more relaxed on the other hand feeling stressful is an unpleasant feeling and I will do my best to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-1-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 1 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really proud of what I did, part of it were already finished before hand such as the user authentication. I wouldn’t totally agree that it is cheating but I have a slight advantage. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-phase-&quot;&gt;Planning Phase ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design Framework Completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-authentication-&quot;&gt;User Authentication ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signup user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User created auto syncs to Database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-new-sheet-&quot;&gt;Create New Sheet ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add New Sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sheet created auto syncs to Database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 👀. There will be a weekly blog every Friday, Stay Tuned.😉&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">From last week’s blog, I started and initiated a challenge – 42 days 6 weeks.

Then I stopped working on that project and pushing it back, like super back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a great solution as nothing is getting finished and achieved. The cycle keeps repeating. Start a new project, code, debug, give up, and over again. I need a better option to change my cycle so I can actually finish a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I read an article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#six-week-cycles&quot;&gt;Six Week Cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically in 6 weeks, 42 days, 1008 hours, 60480 minutes, 3628800 seconds you focus on &lt;strong&gt;ONE THING&lt;/strong&gt;. That one thing could be a project you wanted to start, a hobbie you want to expand, an interest you want to understand and dwell into more in depth etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why 6 weeks, well it’s a short period of time that only takes up 1 month and a half. But long enough to finish the whole progress, including build, launch, test, debug etc and actually see the end result. Not only does it give you a period of time to experiment, play around with your project, but it also motivates and pushes you to finish the project you have set to yourself before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the project succeeded or failed in the end, it only took 6 weeks of your time. Not only it gave you feedback (end result) of the project you are working on, but lets you experiment with creating different projects, exploring different interests and try different hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/42days.png&quot; alt=&quot;42&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting next Wednesday, the 21st of May, I will use this 6 weeks and work on one thing. I am going to plan, start, code, build and launch a website. I chose this specific date to begin with so the last day will be the 30th of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next 6 weeks, I will update my progress here in this weekly blog. Not only will this keep track on my progress, give an in depth summary on what I’m doing but also share some thoughts and tips whilst doing this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this 6 weeks, 42 days challenge is very challenging for me, as I still need to go to lessons and do homeworks. But through this challenge, I want to familiarize with my web development skills and get some extra insights on database server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me who still needs to go to school or work, I suggest to block a few hours every day to work on your one thing. For me, it would be in the afternoon. If you want to join this challenge with me, feel free to comment on the bottom and tell me what project/hobby/interest are you planning to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-project-im-making-is&quot;&gt;The project I’m making is:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A website platform to keep track of monthly, annual cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-hsieh-0749a91a9/&quot;&gt;Linkedin Account&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

But many might ask how did I learn to code, do I recommend coding bootcamps, why did I start and is coding easy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything must date back after the hackathon ended. If you haven’t read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://melaniehsieh.com/journal/2020/04/17/hackathon.html&quot;&gt;Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; blog feel free to go back and read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summer-coding-class&quot;&gt;Summer coding class&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the hackathon, our group won an award. Guess what, the prize is a coding bootcamp voucher. (It was a $4000 voucher 😱. Next time, I would prefer $4000 in cash. lol. 💵)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So during summer, I used the voucher to join a Basic Javascript class because I wanted to understand more details on creating my own website and how to make it more interactive such as adding animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen promotion videos online talking about coding bootcamps, and how they elevate your coding skills after the bootcamps. I was really optemistic about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, expectation never equals to reality. I swear I have been mentioning this exact line over and over again in many blogs. So in conclusion, I absolutely hated it. Not only was it boring, pointless and time consuming, I didn’t learn anything over the course of 2 weeks. I simply just sat there with my computer on and copying the teacher’s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I have 0 knowledge in Javascript, after the program my knowledge still remained 0. However from this unsatisfing experience, I found out many free online resources where I can self teach myself to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Melanie Hsieh once said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When there’s free online resources, why would anyone pay extra for the same exact resources. 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many online resources that are available and free on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-youtube&quot;&gt;1. Youtube&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding has existed since the birth of computers. So many people on youtube will share tips on coding. If you want to learn to code a website, simply type “code a simple website beginner” on the search bar and there will be a list of videos waiting for you to browse. By watching a few of the videos, you can save $4000 and have a finished project working on your computer. 🤯 (I know right, coding is so easy!!! Well technically no. I’ll talk about that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-websites&quot;&gt;2. Websites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freecodecamp&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I self taught myself Javascript with this website, highly recommend it. They include other programming languages such as React, Python, CSS etc. They also have a huge community helping beginners out when you are stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Udacity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Their content are in video format, very clear and easy to understand tutorials/exercises for you to code along. Include topic areas in AI, mobile development, interview prep etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you learn the basics, you should start creating your own projects just to familiarize with your skills, and practice becuase practice makes perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a project is easy, but the progress on creating your own project from scratch is hard. As a beginner you will face tons of bugs. Some of them are nonsense, but some you can learn from, such as you missed a semicolon, you have a typo. Coding might &lt;strong&gt;seem&lt;/strong&gt; easy, but in reality it takes time to build up the skills. It took me 2 years to get from beginner to slightly intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the reason why I continued to code and create softwares is because it makes me feel cool. Some of you may think that sounded stupid and dumb (well you are not alone 😂). I believed that feeling cool is my motivation to continue to create softwares and debug errors. (I laughed when I wrote this line, such nonsense.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I really enjoyed the outcome. From a vision to an actual product that people clicked on it and use, is an unbelievable feeling and satisfaction personally. Although the process is tough and frustrating but once you stepped over the barrier or bug, you will feel extremely proud for 2 seconds and another bug will pop up 😂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend and encourage others to learn to code (and be a nerd like me) but the only criteria is to have a passion in coding/tech. If you don’t find passion in coding, there’s no point on doing it because it’s no fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friend asked me if I would try singing, I would tell her &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; because it’s no fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-fun--boring--waste-of-time--big-brain&quot;&gt;No Fun = Boring = Waste of time (🤯 big brain)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho once wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote sums up everything I just mentioned, so I truely wish everyone luck on finding their own treasure(s). It may be coding, baking, discovering a new island in the middle of atlantic ocean…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck best wishes, and most importantly have &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Day 10 of my challenge, to be honest it has been tough since school started and homeworks have been piling up. 😵 I didn’t achieve as much as I intended to, sort of struggling between balancing school and personal projects. But still glad to see my friends again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this week’s progress was bad. On a scale from 1 - 10, I will say it is a solid 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning I have always aimed for consistency. But after these 10 Days, things have gotten harder and harder. More bugs, less motivation, more homework (worst thing ever, can’t believe they still exist). Needless to say, this week was stressful and daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these troublesome problems, I am glad that I still managed to keep my streak of crosses running. Although somedays I only did a short 10 minutes programming session but I kept myself accountable and didn’t give up. 👏👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is way easier to give up then to continue, but I just want to have a complete product. &lt;strong&gt;Just One Single Complete Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Although erros and bugs are unavoidable but having a clear purpose forced me or even kicked me to continue working on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website might not be used by anyone, but completeing a project means a lot to me. So have a strong clear purpose, a purpose that will someday push or kick you when you feel low and stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plan-for-the-upcoming-week&quot;&gt;Plan for the upcoming week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-category-algorithm&quot;&gt;1. Category algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit more complicated than the other 2 algorithms because it consists of two data source instead of one. I have been pushing this feature back for a while so I hope to finish this as soon as possible so it won’t delay my schedule. (not saying that I have a busy schedule.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-input-sheet&quot;&gt;2. Input Sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add more features on the Create New Sheet page. I want to allow users to control the data-output so it is tailor-made. Not only that, but have a friendly user interface. (probably adding that near the end, when every main components are working together) 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dataformat.png&quot; alt=&quot;dataformat&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-2-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 2 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally finished one of the key features which is the algorithm section that fetches data and return a summary of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;algorithms-&quot;&gt;Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expense algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-introduction&quot;&gt;Brief Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/meeopp/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MeeOpp is an educational technology start up that provide tailored personalized learning system for students to learn Mandarin. Leveraging technology they are seeking to enhance student’s learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-get-in&quot;&gt;How did I get in?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My school hosted a job fair where people from different organizations, companies come to our school to introduce their jobs. I attended a few of them, and one of them was a tech startup co-founder. I was very excited as this was and is my dream job. I wanted to start my own company, change the world and be in fortune 500. During the talk, she mentioned internship oppurtunities for high school students. I really wanted to attend this mainly because I have nothing else to do during summer but also I would like to have a platform to work on my computer coding skills and meet some new people who’s good at tech and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fair, I asked for her contact. Long story short, after a few emails and phone calls, I got the internship.😄🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-weeks&quot;&gt;6 weeks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the internship for 6 full weeks, Monday to Friday and ended the day before school starts. In the beginning, I was extremely nervous as this was my first internship program, but also because I was the youngest member in the whole team.😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this 6 week experience, I participated in meetings, redesigned their current profile page and reprogramed their vocabulary flashcard. I learned a lot about frontend development: frameworks, libaries, languages and many more. Throughout this 6 weeks, I realized that coding buddies are really important especially when you faced bugs, they will give you support and feedbacks to help you out. I also got to talk with many developers in the team who has been working in the company for years. They also gave me some advice and a brief introduction on their role in the dev team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;profile-page&quot;&gt;Profile page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First project I worked on was the profile page redesign. Lets be honest I was a complete beginner at the start, knowing little to nothing about UX/UI designs, I did a few design versions on the profile page. They were decent but still lacking a few professional touches. The page size was incorrect, format was wrong, color scheme was messy and all sort of beginner issues.😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;here-is-the-first-version&quot;&gt;Here is the first version:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/meeopp/v1.png&quot; alt=&quot;v1&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, throughout the 6 weeks Dawid (not a typo), a UX/UI designer who gave me feedbacks on the format, helped me simplify my profile page, and taught me some tips and tricks in Adobe XD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;here-is-the-final-version-much-neater&quot;&gt;Here is the final version (much neater):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/meeopp/profile.png&quot; alt=&quot;v1&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vocabulary-flashcard&quot;&gt;Vocabulary Flashcard&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second project I worked on was the vocabulary flashcard. I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript to build the simple easy to use flashcard system. I decided to make it user friendly so I added key press, which is switching slides by simply pressing left arrow, or right arrow key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were day I felt super stressed and unmotivated because I spent a lot of time debugging. But still can’t manage to debug it after many days. Often times going home frustrated, however the other day when I asked William (a more experienced developer than me), he could solve the bug within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were also days which I felt extremely proud because the flashcard is finally working. I would say my mood changes a lot throughout the day. I think many developers would agree with me because debugging is a really stressful process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-vocabulary-flashcard-yes-i-managed-to-complete-the-redesign&quot;&gt;Final vocabulary flashcard: (Yes, I managed to complete the redesign)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/img/meeopp/v3.png&quot; alt=&quot;v1&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this internship experience, not only did I met some amazing talented people, but I got some insight on how to run a startup company, how a company is slipt into 2 department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-took-away-a-few-lessons&quot;&gt;I took away a few lessons.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask for help&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When I faced a bug and couldn’t debug it after many tries, asking for help is a quick way to reduce the time of mindless scrolling on stackoverflow. But it also helps you to think in ways that you’ve never thought of, especially when you ask people who are more experienced than you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EXPECTATIONS doesn’t equal to REALITY&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Over the past 6 weeks, I feel like coding everyday isn’t my cup of tea as I tend to get impatient about the bugs and I don’t seem to enjoy the process of debugging that much. I realized that my dream career has slightly shifted after this internship oppurtunity as I got the chance to physically experience the process. So I would advice people to experiment with their options instead of just going online and reseach.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on something that you are passionate about&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From this internship, I truly experienced why everyone should work in something they are truely passionate and inspired on. As adults, they go to work everyday, working in something they are passionate about just make &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt; feel less sad. As work covers more than 50% of our life time, working in something you like just makes the effort and time spent more worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-i-recommend-doing-summer-internship&quot;&gt;Do I recommend doing summer internship?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;yes-definitely&quot;&gt;YES, definitely.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage people to do summer interns because they learn and experiment with things that was never taught in school such as technical skills like React and Adobe XD, but you also gain friendship afterwards. (This is what I called networking 😆)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, 2020, I would like to intern in big companies such as Google, Alibaba, Huawei etc. Big companies and startups often have a lot of differences, mainly because one is big with hundreds of employees, and the latter one just began their journey. But I also wanted to meet like-minded people who is passionate about tech, and also they have cooler products.😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Big things must start from small things, and small things are usually simple things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That’s a lot of “things” repeated in the same quote. 😂)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first year of Middle School, I saw a friend of mine coding. When I looked at his computer, I was blowned away. From my primary school experiences I thought coding was just block codes, with a cat hovering on a screen. But he was writing script codes. He was coding in simple HTML and a bit of CSS. This was my first experience in actual real coding. 👩‍💻️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sparked my curiosity in understanding and exploring tech and coding more in depth. I was getting serious abount this hobby. 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hackathon&quot;&gt;Hackathon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around November, our school hosted a Hackathon. Hackathon is basically a 2-day event where students participate this event to get exposure to different coding possivility and a 1-day build day where we present our business ideas to judges about our product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then I just started pure, simple HTML. I only know how to add headings, text and simple styling to my website. Basically &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; experience in coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-1-workshop&quot;&gt;Day 1: Workshop&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Friday and I forced two of my friends to join me in this Hackathon. The only reason why they joined this event wasn’t because they are interested in coding but because we get to skip school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hackathon/esf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;esf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every big event starts with a speech. It was kinda long to be honest, one hour (I have short patience span). But after the boring bit, the fun part begins – &lt;strong&gt;the workshop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to choose 6 workshops to participate over the course, hosted by different coding organizations in Hong Kong. Ranging from simple tutorials on creating a web or app, to making a game from scratch. It didn’t go in depth as every session only took an hour, but there’s one workshop that blew my mind 🤯, it was a tutorial on making an app with Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pokemon app, (yes, back then pokemon go was still a big trend) that simply shows images of pokemons when you tap the screen. I didn’t learn much from this workshop session as everything is still brand new to me, but it made me feel cooler than I was before. When I showed my app to my friends, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Because I know how to code and they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I would consider myself as a &lt;strong&gt;nerd&lt;/strong&gt; 🤓 (I think I still am). I enjoyed everything related to tech. So I find this new hobby, coding extremely suitable to my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;day-2-coding-time-️&quot;&gt;Day 2: Coding time 👩‍💻️&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In groups of 4, we started our actual &lt;strong&gt;Hackathon&lt;/strong&gt;. We came up with a business idea and started to work on it. Someone is responisible on the presentation, someone is responsible on the app design, and someone is responisble on the marketing side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not knowing anything related to marketing and economics/business, my main focus was the marketing side. I made a simple website to promote our business idea, which was a platform that allows users to share items between each other. Spare the details cause I simply can’t remember any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the website, it was the first website I’ve ever made. 👏 It was a blue background web page that has 2 sentences explaining our business idea, and a huge section introducing members of our team, and a &lt;strong&gt;Terms and Condition Section&lt;/strong&gt; made up on the spot by my friend Gemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things never go the way as we planned, and during the hackathon we faced a lot of problems. Especially as a beginner, with zero experience and knowledge. There were times where we got distracted in Papa’s Pizzeria, there were times where we have no clue what we were doing, and there were times where we were demotivated when other teams got a better product, a more professional website than our team. But I still enjoyed the process on working with different people, and comes up with a business idea in one single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, surprisingly we won an award on best idea. Each of us won a gift voucher for a free course from one of the coding org. But after this event, I gained a lot more insights on tech, especially when I realized that coding is much wider and deeper than I thought originially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I will build up my skills on coding and join more competitve Hackathons where teams have to come up with a product and a plan in a certain amount of time period. Most importantly, have better prizes other than vouchers that is only limited to their company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hackathon/group.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;group&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
See if you can find me…🤣&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, no more code snippets or tutorials. (Well only for a while.) I realized most of my readers aren’t interested in coding so I decided to change up the content. I am going to tell stories about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;primary-school&quot;&gt;Primary School&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly 10 years ago, I started primary school. Back then, my favorite subjects were Art and ICT (basically computer class). Mainly because there weren’t any tests and exams. To clarify I’m not the kid with straight A’s, or the kid who’s talented in sports. But I am the kid who hated exams and tests especially dictations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;art-class&quot;&gt;Art class&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like art because it was fun. I remembered once I made a cardboard robot with red pockets with my friends. I enjoyed the process of making something physical from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything is Art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a youtube video explaining how someone put a blank white painting in an art gallery and sold it for millions of dollars. So I thought it would be easy to score an A, as there are a lot of empty white pages in my sketchbook. Well expectations never equal to reality. I learned that from the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality my art grades were C’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-class&quot;&gt;Computer class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I hated computer classes. They were so boring and repetive, each lesson teachers just explain some basic functions of the computer such as what is copy and paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as we started to learn scratch I started to build up my curiosity on writing simple block codes. It was extremely fun as I could basically control the cat, what it does, where it goes. Later on I participated in competitions to enhance my skills. I even won a few awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awards I got might be small comparing them to other people’s. But these small achievements sparked joy, because someone verified my product, they think it’s good. Now that’s something big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

In April, starting this week, I have an Easter Break that lasts for 2 full weeks. Initially, it was meant to be a break so people can go outside and relax, but now everything seems to change. No one could go outside, go on vacations as most countries are in &lt;em&gt;lock-down mode&lt;/em&gt;, hangout with friends. So the only option is to stay at home. During the break I continued on my project - Subtle, the Todo App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I was going on Instagram, and I saw a post about &lt;strong&gt;Types of people during Quarantine&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few that caught my eye, such as &lt;em&gt;the introverts&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the freelancers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;the heros&lt;/em&gt;. But then I thought about programmers/developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a beginner programmer, the ONE THING that ruins my day is &lt;strong&gt;BUG(s)&lt;/strong&gt;. They usually come in the color red, with a vague caption on the top that usually reads &lt;strong&gt;TypeError: Cannot read proprety ‘xxx’ of undefined&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me show you how &lt;strong&gt;BUGS&lt;/strong&gt; affect my daily mood. 😁😡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-is-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-programmer-beginner-version-&quot;&gt;Here is A Day in the Life of a Programmer (beginner version) :&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😁 - I run the code, it runs smoothly 👏(congrats)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😁 - I start to add new features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😡 - I run the code again and something red pops up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😡 - I google the bug, look at my code and do some corrections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😡 - Continue &lt;strong&gt;Step 5 and 6&lt;/strong&gt; over and over again until nothing red shows up, sometimes it might not be an error but the outcome isn’t what I was expecting. On average it takes me 2 hours to debug one singe bug. (Quite time consuming…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😑 - If I can’t debug the code, I usually do something else (i.e. Eat lunch, sleep, watch YouTube)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😁 - Finally, I solved the bug&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😑 - I repeat the steps all over again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my mood swings a lot. Quite drastically, from happy to mad, back to happy and back to mad. Often times I get demotivated as the code seems unsolvable. But I found a few tips and tricks to debug my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-ways-to-debug-your-code&quot;&gt;5 Ways to Debug your code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-use-consolelog&quot;&gt;1. Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In javascript it’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;, in python it’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It prints out the value of a variable you’re declaring in the console&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is an effective way to check your variables, methods, and function. Making sure they are working perfectly, if not it can also pinpoint the error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-use-google&quot;&gt;2. Use Google&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many programming languages have existed for a decade or longer, many problems you faced were also faced by many people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Websites such as Stack Overflow, Github, MDN web docs (if you are using javascript) are great ways to find solutions for your bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-go-on-youtube&quot;&gt;3. Go on Youtube&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Youtube, you can find videos that teaches you how to code from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can reference some of their codes to your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-ask-a-friend&quot;&gt;4. Ask a friend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me who doesn’t have friends that code, use online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discord, join public servers and ask questions. Many people in the server are more experienced than you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reddit, post your question on specific categories or just search for similar bugs and see the responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-sleep&quot;&gt;5. Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times, I take breaks in between just to relax my brain cells (kinda). For me the best thing is just to take a break. Often times I think of alternative ways to solve the bug or even different ways to get the final results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog gave you some simple tips and tricks on debugging when you face bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-1-back-end&quot;&gt;Part 1: Back End&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned from last week’s blog, front end is basically the user side. What the user sees and interact. The back end is the opposite, it is the the database side. It stores all the user’s data, the user won’t see it which is why it’s called &lt;strong&gt;back&lt;/strong&gt; end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-2-installations&quot;&gt;Part 2: Installations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MongoDB (This is a free database I am using)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mongoose (MongoDB framework)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express (Node framework)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node (Node links the database with your app)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodemon (Node framework that auto updates the terminal once you saved your code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm i mongoose nodemon express axios --save&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-3-setting-up&quot;&gt;Part 3: Setting Up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder in the same todo app project as last week’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then call git init and install all the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nodemon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;. Create a port that will host your server. You can type in any number but I usually use port 5000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Server connected to: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test run, simply type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nodemon server&lt;/code&gt; to your terminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/todo/localhost.png&quot; alt=&quot;localhost&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;mongodb_url&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with your url, you can find it in the connect section once you created your cluster. This will connect your MongoDB to the app. &lt;em&gt;Quick tip: Use the free cluster when you are starting a new project in MongoDB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mongodb_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useNewUrlParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useCreateIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;useUnifiedTopology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Connected to MongoDB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/todo/mongo.png&quot; alt=&quot;mongo&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;model&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up the server, we will create a &lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt;. It will create objects to be declared, so basically columns that is used to locate and store the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TodoSchema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;timestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;router&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-request&quot;&gt;Get Request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will get all the available data that is saved into the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Errors: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-request&quot;&gt;Post Request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will send data to MongoDB once it is called. It will create a new todo row for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;newTodo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newTodo&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Todo added!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Errors: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is a very important step, as it determines whether your backend server and the MongoDB work. You need to install &lt;strong&gt;Postman&lt;/strong&gt; in google web store. It is an extension. Then paste in your localhost (remember to add the url in your router behind the localhost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:5000/todos/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/todo/postman.png&quot; alt=&quot;localhost&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click the &lt;strong&gt;POST&lt;/strong&gt; button on the left and enter value in &lt;strong&gt;body&lt;/strong&gt;. When you press submit, it should say &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Todo Added&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you change the button to &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; on the left hand side menu. When you press submit, it should say list out the todo you added before hand. In my case it would be ‘Clean Room’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Backend is Working.🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog gave you a simple tutorial on adding your backend to the existing Todo App. Next week we will look at how to connect frontend to backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have put the full source code for this week’s tutorial on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/melaniehsieh/subtle&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further question you can always email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:melanie@melaniehsieh.com&quot;&gt;melanie@melaniehsieh.com&lt;/a&gt; or find me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/melaniehsieh&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/melaniehsieh&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 👀. There will be a weekly blog every Friday, Stay Tuned.😉&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">From last week’s blog, we introduced the front end design of the app. This week we will be going through the back end of the app.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 1 Todo App</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/coding/2020/03/27/todoapp.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 1 Todo App" /><published>2020-03-27T20:00:04+08:00</published><updated>2020-03-27T20:00:04+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/coding/2020/03/27/todoapp</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/coding/2020/03/27/todoapp.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the project this year is to make a Todo App. If you search &lt;em&gt;todo app&lt;/em&gt; in the app store or play store there are a lot of options. However I tried a few of them, and often they are either too complicated to use, or they are just missing some functions I want. So this upcoming month, I am planning to launch my Todo App called &lt;strong&gt;Subtle&lt;/strong&gt; from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-1-planning-phase&quot;&gt;Part 1: Planning Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the planning I used &lt;strong&gt;Adobe XD&lt;/strong&gt; to help me finalize the design. Adobe XD is a free app that helps you design the &lt;strong&gt;UI (User Interface)&lt;/strong&gt; of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few snap shots of my app (in planning phase). I am aiming for a minimalistic app, which is simple and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/todo/zoomin.png&quot; alt=&quot;zoomin&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you finalize the UI of the app, let’s move on to the code. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-2-front-end&quot;&gt;Part 2: Front End&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating an app there is &lt;strong&gt;Front End&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Back End&lt;/strong&gt;. Front End is the client side, where it consists of &lt;em&gt;UI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;color scheme&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UX&lt;/em&gt;. Back End is the database side, where it consists of &lt;em&gt;database&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;schemas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;authentication&lt;/em&gt; and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start with the &lt;strong&gt;Front End&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React Native (A programming language developed by &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;, it isn’t a native language which means it doesn’t use &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Kotlin&lt;/em&gt;. But it uses &lt;em&gt;Javascript&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Typescript&lt;/em&gt; to build apps that are available for both IOS and Android devices 😀 )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VS Code (Code Editor, I want to switch to &lt;em&gt;Vim&lt;/em&gt; but I don’t have time to learn and install all the bundles and depencies, so I am sticking with VS Code)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iTerm (Terminal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;part-3-setting-up&quot;&gt;Part 3: Setting Up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cli&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newProject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//your project name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newProject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//your project name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used expo to setup my project. Expo is a tool that can help you build a React Native app quickly, there is also an app (Expo) which you can install on your phone to render your app live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doubletap&quot;&gt;DoubleTap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TouchableOpacity&lt;/code&gt; button with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DoubleTap&lt;/code&gt;. So when you double tap the screen it will submit the todo item to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DoubleTapButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onDoubleTap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onHandlerStateChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeEvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onDoubleTap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onDoubleTap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TapGestureHandler&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onHandlerStateChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onHandlerStateChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;numberOfTaps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/TapGestureHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onsubmit&quot;&gt;onSubmit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TextInput&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DoubleTap&lt;/code&gt;. When you double tap the screen, the item in the text input should call a function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this.onSubmit&lt;/code&gt;. It should console log the item on your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addtodo&quot;&gt;AddTodo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if...else&lt;/code&gt; statement so it could switch pages easily. Not sure if this is the most effective way. I am planning to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Routes&lt;/code&gt; next time just to test different methods out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DoubleTapButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onDoubleTap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontLoaded&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TextInput&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onChangeText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 👀. There will be a weekly blog every Friday, Stay Tuned.😉&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One of the project this year is to make a Todo App. If you search todo app in the app store or play store there are a lot of options. However I tried a few of them, and often they are either too complicated to use, or they are just missing some functions I want. So this upcoming month, I am planning to launch my Todo App called Subtle from scratch.</summary></entry></feed>
