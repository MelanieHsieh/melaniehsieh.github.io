&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has gain massive popularity in the last few decades. Many popular applications uses machine learning to help companies do things that couldn’t be done before. For example, Netflix’s movie recommendation, Email’s spam identifier, Siri’s virtual personal assitants. This also include hospitals use ML to identify lung cancer using image recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML is mainly seperated into 2 groups – Classification and Regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt; predicts a discrete class label. For example identifying if the given image is a dog or a cat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand predicts a continuous quantity. For example predicting house prices given a certain location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;linear-vs-polynomial-regression&quot;&gt;Linear vs Polynomial Regression&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/reg.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear Regression is the simplest regression model. It uses the equation of a straight line &lt;code&gt; y = a + bx + e &lt;/code&gt; to map out the data set and identifies the line of best fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;y : the dependent variable (output)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;x : the independent variable (input)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a : the y-intercept&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;b : the gradient or slope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e : the error rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polynomial Regression is another regression model, similar to linear regression but predicts the curve of best fit. The general equation is &lt;code&gt; y = a + b1x + b2x^2 +....+ bnx^n &lt;/code&gt;, in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. The higher the nth degree, the more accurate the curve will be corresponding to its datapoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, I’ve decided to use &lt;strong&gt;Polynomial Regression model&lt;/strong&gt; to identify the user’s greatest average vibration value from different time period. Reason being my datapoints do not show an obvious correlation between the x and y-axis, polnomial fits wider range of curvature and more accurate prediction. However, they are very sensitive to outliers, if there are one or two anomaly datapoints, it will affect the result of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;application&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important feature that ML needs is &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to have a precise and accurate prediction, they need many many training and testing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/model.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have drew this simple diagram out to visualize what I’m planning to do with my input datasets (the vibration value I’ve collected with the Nung device). Here is what I did with the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export dataset into CSV (so the python model can use it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use polynomial regression model to draw a near-accurate curve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the max-points of the graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the coordinates of the max point &lt;strong&gt;(time, vibration_value)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/50.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  x_axis = numpy.linspace(x[0], x, 50) # range, generation
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
  y_axis = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 5)) # draw x y, 5 nth terms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used jupyter notebook and python to draw this polynomial regression. As you can see both graph return the same datasets and curve of best fit, however the graph on the right is more accurate because it has higher nth term and generation.&lt;/p&gt;

A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. In simpler terms, many people suffered from Parkinson’s disease but it is not curable. &lt;em&gt;If deep brain stimulation (DBS) is mature enough then there’s a chance for PD to be curable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By addressing this problem, I will be creating a tech device that could possibly help hospitals to offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;product&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a wearable tech device – &lt;strong&gt;Nung&lt;/strong&gt;. It can accurately capture patient’s vibration value throughout the day. Tracking and analyzing recurring pattern to help hospitals make better medication decisions for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does it provide accurate data to hospitals, it also brings convieniences to PD patients when they revisit their doctors. Usually, patients will &lt;strong&gt;recall&lt;/strong&gt; their past symptoms and ask doctor for further medication adjustment. However, it is difficult to recall every single detail, thus making the medication adjustment inaccurate, and inefficient. But with the use of this wearable tech device, hospitals can identify the vibration pattern with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;electronics&quot;&gt;Electronics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;s&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESP8266 (wifi module)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SW420 (vibration sensor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breadboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jumper wires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/assembled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to switch from Arduino Uno/Nano to ESP8266. The main reason is because it can post the data to the database without the need to connect the electronics with an usb cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SW420 captures the vibration data from the user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the time and vibration data to a database (I’m using Firebase)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The website will get the data stored in the database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Output a linear graph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;output&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
By graphing this out, hospitals can visualize patient’s condition &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;X-Axis - Time in seconds. (Haven’t changed the x-axis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Y-Axis - Vibration value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video controls=&quot;true&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-upcoming-month&quot;&gt;This Upcoming Month…&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a ML model to analyze the dataset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify certain time period that has the highest average vibration value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding a battery so the electronic can go full &lt;em&gt;wireless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User test&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don’t like writing, I would much rather spend the time building…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the technology community, open-source is one of the key concept. In simpler terms, open-source means sharing knowledge with others for free. So here I am, open-sourcing my experience as an intern at Evident 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, I joined Evident working as a summer intern. I’m extremely grateful for this learning opportunity where I get to work with talented people, Hemant, Anh and Florian. Getting a deeper understanding on both the engineering and business side but also participating and getting a deeper insight on running a Fintech startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;engineering&quot;&gt;Engineering:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Engineering = Execution = Output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 6 weeks, I created, developed and built a digital PDF contract viewer. This allowed users to view PDF contracts on the Evident website easily with a click of a button. In addition, it also included a signature component where users can sign and append the signature to the PDF document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really challenging at first, as I need to learn a new programming language, Vue, understand the flow of the digital contract, and create this digital contract component from scratch. Although it was difficult, I find communicating with my team really useful in terms of getting everyone on the same page and helping each other out when we faced issues or bugs. Which reduced a lot of friction when deploying the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business&quot;&gt;Business:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Business = Planning = Researching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on the Business side was completely different comparing it to the Engineering side. In Engineering everything was about the result, the execution and the output. On the other hand, business focuses more on the process, researching and planning. Although they follow different paths, they are heading toward the same destination – developing the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored many leading finance technology such as blockchain, wealth container and LPF. Taking it deeper dive at the current finance and technology world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed working and being part of the Evident team, and special thanks to the COO of this company, Florian for sharing some of his personal experiences when it comes to starting and building a successful startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful time and gained a lot from this summer internship. I will definitely aim to build a tech startup that brings value to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remebered on my 42 Days Challenge blog, I set myself a target: to launch Cashrithm. But sadly that didn’t go as planned.😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-is-what-i-learned&quot;&gt;Here is what I learned&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-always-have-a-clear-plan&quot;&gt;1. Always have a clear plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, in the middle of the challenge I would change my tech stack because eiter I found a better tool or I decided it was too hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Stack I used for this challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firebase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node Express&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-research-research-research&quot;&gt;2. Research Research Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is extremely important especially when you are still new to this technology. See if you can find similar products from the open-source library or the internet in general and read their code. Not only will this save you time from debugging, but you can also learn from their code architect and see how you can make your program more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-break-tasks-into-smaller-more-manageble-tasks&quot;&gt;3. Break tasks into smaller more manageble tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split the work flow into daily checklists, make them small and accomplishable. Remember your goal is to build up momentum, not finishe everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really glad this challenge ended, from this challenge I learned a lot of new technology. Backend and frontend, but most importantly I achieved something instead of giving up. I will continue coding this project, and if you are interested check out my next month blog.😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;last-weekly-blog&quot;&gt;Last Weekly Blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my last weekly blog.😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain… The main reason why I decided to stop writing weekly blogs are because I need to prep for an upcoming exam. But also I’m getting bored of writing short paragraphs every week. I wouldn’t say my day-to-day life is interesting nor fun, it’s quite plain and repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m switching up the flow. I will be doing monthly blogs instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monthly-blogs&quot;&gt;Monthly Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized monthly blogs are great alternatives. Not only will there be more content for me to write and talk about, but also I get to document the full progress of my challenging and fun projects; as they normally will be completed over a month or two. But also, I’m lazy. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further a do, see you next month ~ August… 🍂🍂🍂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the final week and I haven’t explained the website thoroughly 😂. So this week I have decided to introduce the application I’ve been building for the last 38 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cashrithm&quot;&gt;Cashrithm&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cashrithm, a mix of &lt;strong&gt;Cash&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; aims to support and help small and medium entreprises to track their cashflow using pre-written algorithms. Aiming to provide an accurate data analysis and feedback to the user, reduce their time and effort to track their expenses, or revenue but focus more on their customer or product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Cashrithm is a simple website that provides a platform for users to upload their data in csv format, process data with pre-written algorithms and functions then provide an accurate summary of the data such as summing up the Revenue, categorize the Expense and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/home.png&quot; alt=&quot;home&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a minimal Dashboard that users will see after Login.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/add.png&quot; alt=&quot;add&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When you click on the plus button in the Dashboard page, it will direct you to the Add Data page which allow users to upload their csv files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/sheet.png&quot; alt=&quot;sheet&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When you click on the created data item it will direct you to a page that displays all the data, categories. Currently this page is still the first version, I will update the UX/UI of this page later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I create this website? To be honest this idea came from my mom’s friend. It may seem obvious as I have zero experience and knowledge in accountant and finance. But the main reason why I have decided to make this website from scratch is for &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I actually had the thought of earning a ton of money with this website, but as I started the coding journey the idea of earning money seemed a bit too far and stretched. So instead I took this challenge as a learning journey. I understood more in the backend side of the application such as database, user authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-6-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 6 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing new was added, but I made the application more scalable as I coded a few functions that could sum up the value, or categorize values when the functions are called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;function-algorithms-&quot;&gt;Function Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sum Algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category Algorithm based on Vender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As the deadline gets closer and closer, I can slowly feel the pressure. I’m blaming the pressure on the 42 days challenge I started. Not only do I have to keep the promise I made but also I really wanted to reach my milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was not fun at all, not only do I need to balance my school works but debugging takes forever to get debugged… (Someday when I have the capacity to hire someone, I will definetly hire a debugger. Hear me out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mvp&quot;&gt;MVP&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I want to introduce a new concept – MVP. MVP stands for &lt;strong&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/strong&gt;, not most valuable player. As a high school programmer and engineerer my connections are pretty limited, let’s be honest I only have less than 10 connections on Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, that is not the main point. The main point is if you are the general public, &lt;em&gt;cough cough&lt;/em&gt; me included, you and I will not care about the process, but the outcome, the final product and is it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as a 16 year old high schooler my resources are pretty limited. No experience, No team members (yes, I am a solo developer for now, if you want to help out please email me), No money. To sum it up, all I have is time and passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can I leverage my resources properly but also meet the market need (produce a product)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-list-out-all-the-must-have-features&quot;&gt;Step 1: List out all the must have features.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already have an idea in mind, I will recommend list out all the compulsory features. Make sure they are minimum, removing as many extra features, those aren’t that important for now because they can be added once your MVP is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:
In this project, one of the must-have feature is a database that could store user’s information and sheet information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-find-simple-open-source-tools&quot;&gt;Step 2: Find Simple Open-Source tools.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to make a chair there are 3 plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan A: You make the hammer by yourself by cutting down wood and finding a malleable rock. Then you use the hammer to build the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan B: You purchase the hammer, and use it to build the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan C: You purchase the chair. (But you don’t have enough money…)💸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking that back to coding, Plan B seems to work the best out of the three. So instead of building everything from scratch, the hammer, you use tools that are made prior to your project. In my case Open-Source, there are many open-source materials in the internet decreasing your production time by half but they are also easy to use and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-test-run&quot;&gt;Step 3: Test Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before submitting your project, test run your application. Do a final checkup on every single funciton and detail, make sure everything runs smoothly, before launching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-5-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 5 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I tackled a few of the boring tasks. Debugging, debugging and debugging. Simple but boring. Will be adding more MVP features in the upcoming weeks, including csv file upload and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;removed-previous-errors-and-bugs-&quot;&gt;Removed previous errors and bugs ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The application can now add multiple sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link directly to the database, Firebase Firestore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;View data sheet by sheet id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this 7 days, I have been working and improving the design basically the user interface or user experience of my website. Although previously I’ve already designed the mockup, but after a bit of research and a bit of experimenting with the color schemes, I’ve decided to redo my design. It was a big commitment as I basically redo the whole entire website, which took me around 4+ hours to finish it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-design&quot;&gt;THE DESIGN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I bother to redesign and remake the website? Well, first of all layout and design of a product such as a website is extremenly important. Because many people including me &lt;strong&gt;judge a book by its cover&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s be realistic when people see an aesthetically pleasing website, they will definitely click on it and explore around rather than just close the tab and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don’t take art, nor a professional designer, but I have common sense. I basically used my instinct to determine whether this page looks good or needed a few changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talking…Here are a few screen shots of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dataformater.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used neumorphic design to spice up the original mockups. I added a few shadows to the corners making the buttons look more 3D. Clean and minimal are my first priorities. This could help the users maneuver over the website smoothly, removing some friction and hopefully making the website look professional so people won’t notice a high schooler made this. But a ‘designer’ built this. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way if you are curious on how I landed this design, I actually did a few googling and testing on Adobe XD before comitting 3+ hours to actually style them on my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel free to comment below and give me some suggestions/advice on the design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-4-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 4 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, it is back on the server side coding. I will be focusing on writing functions. Hopefully it could simplify my existing code and makes the application more scalable for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uxui-design-&quot;&gt;UX/UI Design ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed a minimal web layout and implemented it to the actual website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h1&gt;

Halfway through and 3 more weeks to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to say I have successfully launched a new feature. &lt;strong&gt;Categories algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;, this algorithm is the most difficult algorithm to code out of the other 2. I have been coding this particular section for a few weeks. Many times I was stucked in the infinie loop of bugs, but I am happy to announce the first version of Revenue, Expense, Categories algorithm is successfullly running. 👏👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;version-10-features&quot;&gt;Version 1.0 features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
Version 1.0 is a bare bone framework and feature of Cashrithm. This will include 3 algorithms that sums up the data, categorize data based on Vender name and filter unecessary data value out based on the google sheet url which the user will input in a given input box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this version is not scalable as the algorithm is only limited to a few data sheet, and the run time is quite slow. In order to make my life simplier and easier in the future, I have decided to convert them into functions. A function for summing up all the value of a given column, a function that categorize value based on the Vender name and many more. In the future, if I wanted to add new algorithms, I can just simply add a few lines of code and Voila the algorithm is running. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my self-taught coding journey, I’ve learned that &lt;strong&gt;write once run anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; is a super important hack that could save me a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;version-11&quot;&gt;Version 1.1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/summary.png&quot; alt=&quot;summary&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
Since Version 1.0 is the bare bone skeleton of the structure of the program, Version 1.1 should be the fun stuff that gets implemented. I’m still confused by the numbering of the versions, some have 3 digits. I’ll just stick with 2 for now. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next 3 weeks, I will be working on version 1.1. Hopefully improving the user experience when they go on my website. But I will also fix some bugs I’ve been avoiding lately (mainly because debugging is a stressful and boring process, let’s hope in the future someone created a machine that could rewrite my code and make it bug-free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m extremely excited, and hopefully the outcome after 6 weeks could wow myself as this is big milestone for me, personally. 🎯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-3-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 3 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will continue coding the input area where users can control what they want to see in the final summary sheet. On the other hand, I would convert all algorithms into functions that could be called easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;algorithms-&quot;&gt;Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Halfway through and 3 more weeks to go!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/week2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 2" /><published>2020-05-29T01:48:04+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-29T01:48:04+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/week2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/week2/">&lt;p&gt;Week Number Two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Day 10 of my challenge, to be honest it has been tough since school started and homeworks have been piling up. 😵 I didn’t achieve as much as I intended to, sort of struggling between balancing school and personal projects. But still glad to see my friends again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this week’s progress was bad. On a scale from 1 - 10, I will say it is a solid 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning I have always aimed for consistency. But after these 10 Days, things have gotten harder and harder. More bugs, less motivation, more homework (worst thing ever, can’t believe they still exist). Needless to say, this week was stressful and daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these troublesome problems, I am glad that I still managed to keep my streak of crosses running. Although somedays I only did a short 10 minutes programming session but I kept myself accountable and didn’t give up. 👏👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is way easier to give up then to continue, but I just want to have a complete product. &lt;strong&gt;Just One Single Complete Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Although erros and bugs are unavoidable but having a clear purpose forced me or even kicked me to continue working on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website might not be used by anyone, but completeing a project means a lot to me. So have a strong clear purpose, a purpose that will someday push or kick you when you feel low and stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plan-for-the-upcoming-week&quot;&gt;Plan for the upcoming week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-category-algorithm&quot;&gt;1. Category algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a bit more complicated than the other 2 algorithms because it consists of two data source instead of one. I have been pushing this feature back for a while so I hope to finish this as soon as possible so it won’t delay my schedule. (not saying that I have a busy schedule.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-input-sheet&quot;&gt;2. Input Sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add more features on the Create New Sheet page. I want to allow users to control the data-output so it is tailor-made. Not only that, but have a friendly user interface. (probably adding that near the end, when every main components are working together) 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dataformat.png&quot; alt=&quot;dataformat&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-2-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 2 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally finished one of the key features which is the algorithm section that fetches data and return a summary of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;algorithms-&quot;&gt;Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expense algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Within the next 6 weeks, from 20th of May to 30th of June, I will be focusing on one project which is a website that tracks cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;stage-1-planning-phase&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Planning phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the first 2 days to plan out the week. Having a clear vision and purpose in the early stage can highly improve the effiency of the work flow, not only does it give clarity to the work I’m doing but it also motivates me to check off tasks from my list of todos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/design.png&quot; alt=&quot;design&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualize&quot;&gt;Visualize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to visualize the outcome and structure of the website. I created this framwork structure that clearly displays the bare bone of my website. From this skeleton framework, it shows how many pages are there on the website, how are they linked and which section needs access to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a visual person 👀. Before starting any project, I need to have a broad image of the product in my head. What are the key functions, what does it look like and what special features that makes the application interesting. Creating this design framework above, simply makes me visualize the image of the product clearer. Fun fact, I used different colors to represent different sections: blue = navigation bar, turquoise = algorithms, yellow = sheets etc, so it will look less boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-careful-not-to-get-stuck-in-the-planning-loop&quot;&gt;Be careful not to get stuck in the Planning Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people might want to have the perfect plan, however a perfect plan doesn’t exist in my case. Because I’m still a very inexperienced programmer who has been coding for the past 2 years only (sort of, took a few breaks in between).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning is important, but not the most important thing when needed to finish a project. I like to experiment with things. When I did some testing and researches on databases, it broadens my knowledge and view on them. Instead of planning every single step I much prefer experimenting and trying out new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;stage-2-start-building&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Start building&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After planning the broad looks and functions of the website, I began to code. First of all, I started adding components. A create new sheet page, login and signup pages for adding new users and a bit of styling to make the page more colorful. (Actually from the design framework above, all the rectangles which are filled in are finished, and the small squares on the top left are database. If I add those squares on specific component, it means they need access to the database.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today will be the end of 3rd day. I still have 4 days to go until the first week is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;here-is-my-plan-so-hear-me-out&quot;&gt;Here is my plan, so hear me out&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be adding a new component – tabs. This will allow the user to edit and add the name of each tab in the google spreadsheet to the platform. &lt;em&gt;If there’s extra time, I hope to sync the tabs to the database.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;, I will be taking a break. Hopefully able to go on a hike with my mates if the weather is good, preferably sunny and windy day (opitimal hiking weather).☀️💨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a break is necessary, not only does it frees up your brain from all the clutter you have been stacking up from the week, but it is also good for your mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no work is getting done on Sunday. 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;, debugging time. When adding new features to my website I am pretty sure some unecessary issues and bugs will pop up. I like to leave myself a day or two just to check on the code to see if it runs smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get stressed when things bugs are popping up, especially when the deadline is closing by. So leaving extra time to double check just makes me feel more relaxed on the other hand feeling stressful is an unpleasant feeling and I will do my best to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-1-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 1 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really proud of what I did, part of it were already finished before hand such as the user authentication. I wouldn’t totally agree that it is cheating but I have a slight advantage. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-phase-&quot;&gt;Planning Phase ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design Framework Completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-authentication-&quot;&gt;User Authentication ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signup user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User created auto syncs to Database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-new-sheet-&quot;&gt;Create New Sheet ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add New Sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sheet created auto syncs to Database&lt;/li&gt;
