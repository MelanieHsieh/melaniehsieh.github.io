&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number ONE:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s a new decade 🔟. &lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt; means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It’s a year where I want to improve myself &lt;em&gt;exponentially&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number TWO:&lt;/strong&gt; I turned 16. 🎂🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number THREE:&lt;/strong&gt; I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;covid-19-in-hong-kong&quot;&gt;Covid-19 in Hong Kong&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 near the end of January, more than 100 countries are infected. which included Hong Kong. This made all the schools closed down and holiday extension. I am not complaninig about the extra few days of holidays, but not able to go outside freely sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wearing a mask is uncomfortable, makes my face sweaty as the air inside doesn’t circulate properly. 😷 But wearing a mask is very important especially these days, as corona virus is deadly 🦠. So for your family, friends’ health and safety, also other people in your neighborhood or community, I urge you to &lt;strong&gt;wear a mask&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In Decemeber 31st, 2019 I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PROJECT MINIMAL</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/update/2020/03/10/projectminimal.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PROJECT MINIMAL" /><published>2020-03-10T20:12:58+08:00</published><updated>2020-03-10T20:12:58+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/update/2020/03/10/projectminimal</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/update/2020/03/10/projectminimal.html">&lt;p&gt;Starting 2020 off with a bang 🎉, even though I’m late to the game for 3 months but whatever. The purpose of this weekly blog (more like when I’m feeling writing mode blog 😂) is simple, I want to share my tips and tricks on programming and some day to day experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is the first time I tried blogging, this is still an experimenting phrase, which means this website will change up quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;WHY&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Melanie Hsieh once said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every project must start with a &lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I’m pretty sure someone famous said that, but since this is my blog I can say whatever I want.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal or &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt; is to inspire other girls to pursue engineering or tech, pursue might not be the word but introducing them to &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful World of Technology&lt;/em&gt;. The number of &lt;em&gt;Women in Tech&lt;/em&gt; 👩‍💻️ is still low, and the future world defenitely needs more engineerer. So why not combine the two of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is why &lt;strong&gt;Project Minimal&lt;/strong&gt; is created. I don’t even know how I came up with this name but someday sometime somewhere it just pops up in my head so I’m sticking with my gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple minimal website (&lt;em&gt;you can see it from the title&lt;/em&gt;) I decided to create to document my experience in tech and share my thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#projectminimal&lt;/code&gt; community, the main purpose is to inspire others to get into technology engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Starting 2020 off with a bang 🎉, even though I’m late to the game for 3 months but whatever.
