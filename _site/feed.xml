&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/curve4.png&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make life easier, I have drawn this curve to represent myself in different stages of this project. &lt;strong&gt;Yellow ball represents me, and Nung is the end goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-the-motivation&quot;&gt;1 The motivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first few days, the motivation was huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I had the idea of helping PD patients on recieving better and more accurate medication, I was determined to do my best and become the change to launch this wearable tech device. My eye was on the final outcome – Nung, this is why the ball is parallel to the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see and vision the goal, but to achieve it there’s a long way ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-dip&quot;&gt;2 The dip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started to delve into all sorts of research research and research, I slowly realized there weren’t any pre-existing product on this PD idea. Many ideas were on how to find or discover people with Parkinson’s Diease earlier. However, not much were being done in the process of having PD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing a handful of research, it is time to experiment, trial and error and most important it is time to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining something you enjoy with your project is extremely fullfilling as you will never get bored. Until, the bugs and errors started to popup. I experimented with countless of models, prototypes, scripts, and programs. Finding the most relevant electronics that could run wirelessly and send data wirelessly is a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time progresses, I felt lost, moving further and further away from my end goal. There was times I couldn’t see the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have reached the rock bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-climb&quot;&gt;3 The climb&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, I have got an oppurtunity to work with a year four engineering student from Hong Kong City University. He helped me tremendously with debugging the code. And for the first time in 1 month, my program is finally working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I started to gain momentum. Finished and self learned some Machine Learning algorithms, straight after that solder the electronics, design the casing and finally assembling everything together. I was climbing up the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-success&quot;&gt;4 SUCCESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 4 months of dedication, hard work, and countless of failures, I have finally finished and test ran Nung on a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/case1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/case2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A kind reminder: this product is not FDA approved, nor professionally made. It’s just me being bored.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, I’ve been wanting to read this new Chinese novel series, 慶餘年. It has 760 chapters, each chapter with a few thousand Chinese character. Also, this novel series was highly recommended by my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what I came up…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An audiobook that is sort of a replica Amazon’s Audible. Imagine there is a software where you paste in the link of the book, it converts the file into pdf then use text-to-speech recognition to read the characters out loud. How cool would that be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the the 4 key steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-find-the-book-online&quot;&gt;1 Find the book online&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this website that offers &lt;a href=&quot;http://big5.quanben-xiaoshuo.com/n/qingyunian/xiazai.html&quot;&gt;慶餘年&lt;/a&gt; in TXT format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-convert-txt-to-pdf-format&quot;&gt;2 Convert TXT to PDF format&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took me a while as there were 760 chapters. But here is a simple snipet where I used the &lt;em&gt;pdfkit&lt;/em&gt; library to convert from txt to pdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pdfkit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;shutil&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'.pdf'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdfkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'http://big5.quanben-xiaoshuo.com'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;old&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;r''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;r'./慶餘年/'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shutil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;move&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;old&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-text-to-speech&quot;&gt;3 Text to Speech&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the fun part. I used Google’s &lt;strong&gt;gTTS Library&lt;/strong&gt; to process text into speech. They offer a wide range of language, including Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French etc. I then wrote a simple script to tell the program to read every character from the PDF document I generated previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the gTTS Library isn’t the newest libary offered. It often skips past a few vocabulary such as &lt;strong&gt;‘⼦’, ‘一’, ‘黑’&lt;/strong&gt;. This made the whole audio book sounds incomplete making the whole user experience bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;gtts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gTTS&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myAudio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gTTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getvalue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'zh-yu'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;myAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Audio.mp3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還沒有數完，他就歎了⼀⼝氣，很傷⼼地放棄了這個⼯作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“可我不是⾔情啊。”範慎咕噥著，但由於兩頜的肌⾁沒有了作⽤，所以變成⼀串含糊的囈語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他望著⾃⼰的中指頭，很同情⾃⼰，“我還是處男。”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⼰吧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has gain massive popularity in the last few decades. Many popular applications uses machine learning to help companies do things that couldn’t be done before. For example, Netflix’s movie recommendation, Email’s spam identifier, Siri’s virtual personal assitants. This also include hospitals use ML to identify lung cancer using image recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML is mainly seperated into 2 groups – Classification and Regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt; predicts a discrete class label. For example identifying if the given image is a dog or a cat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand predicts a continuous quantity. For example predicting house prices given a certain location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;linear-vs-polynomial-regression&quot;&gt;Linear vs Polynomial Regression&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/reg.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear Regression is the simplest regression model. It uses the equation of a straight line &lt;code&gt; y = a + bx + e &lt;/code&gt; to map out the data set and identifies the line of best fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;y : the dependent variable (output)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;x : the independent variable (input)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a : the y-intercept&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;b : the gradient or slope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e : the error rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polynomial Regression is another regression model, similar to linear regression but predicts the curve of best fit. The general equation is &lt;code&gt; y = a + b1x + b2x^2 +....+ bnx^n &lt;/code&gt;, in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. The higher the nth degree, the more accurate the curve will be corresponding to its datapoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, I’ve decided to use &lt;strong&gt;Polynomial Regression model&lt;/strong&gt; to identify the user’s greatest average vibration value from different time period. Reason being my datapoints do not show an obvious correlation between the x and y-axis, polnomial fits wider range of curvature and more accurate prediction. However, they are very sensitive to outliers, if there are one or two anomaly datapoints, it will affect the result of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;application&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important feature that ML needs is &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to have a precise and accurate prediction, they need many many training and testing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/model.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have drew this simple diagram out to visualize what I’m planning to do with my input datasets (the vibration value I’ve collected with the Nung device). Here is what I did with the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export dataset into CSV (so the python model can use it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use polynomial regression model to draw a near-accurate curve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the max-points of the graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the coordinates of the max point &lt;strong&gt;(time, vibration_value)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/50.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  x_axis = numpy.linspace(x[0], x, 50) # range, generation
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
  y_axis = numpy.poly1d(numpy.polyfit(x, y, 5)) # draw x y, 5 nth terms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used jupyter notebook and python to draw this polynomial regression. As you can see both graph return the same datasets and curve of best fit, however the graph on the right is more accurate because it has higher nth term and generation.&lt;/p&gt;

A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. In simpler terms, many people suffered from Parkinson’s disease but it is not curable. &lt;em&gt;If deep brain stimulation (DBS) is mature enough then there’s a chance for PD to be curable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By addressing this problem, I will be creating a tech device that could possibly help hospitals to offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;product&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a wearable tech device – &lt;strong&gt;Nung&lt;/strong&gt;. It can accurately capture patient’s vibration value throughout the day. Tracking and analyzing recurring pattern to help hospitals make better medication decisions for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does it provide accurate data to hospitals, it also brings convieniences to PD patients when they revisit their doctors. Usually, patients will &lt;strong&gt;recall&lt;/strong&gt; their past symptoms and ask doctor for further medication adjustment. However, it is difficult to recall every single detail, thus making the medication adjustment inaccurate, and inefficient. But with the use of this wearable tech device, hospitals can identify the vibration pattern with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;electronics&quot;&gt;Electronics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/structure.png&quot; alt=&quot;s&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ESP8266 (wifi module)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SW420 (vibration sensor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breadboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jumper wires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/assembled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to switch from Arduino Uno/Nano to ESP8266. The main reason is because it can post the data to the database without the need to connect the electronics with an usb cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SW420 captures the vibration data from the user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the time and vibration data to a database (I’m using Firebase)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The website will get the data stored in the database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Output a linear graph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;output&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nung/graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
By graphing this out, hospitals can visualize patient’s condition &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;X-Axis - Time in seconds. (Haven’t changed the x-axis)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Y-Axis - Vibration value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I don’t like writing, I would much rather spend the time building…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the technology community, open-source is one of the key concept. In simpler terms, open-source means sharing knowledge with others for free. So here I am, open-sourcing my experience as an intern at Evident 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, I joined Evident working as a summer intern. I’m extremely grateful for this learning opportunity where I get to work with talented people, Hemant, Anh and Florian. Getting a deeper understanding on both the engineering and business side but also participating and getting a deeper insight on running a Fintech startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;engineering&quot;&gt;Engineering:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Engineering = Execution = Output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 6 weeks, I created, developed and built a digital PDF contract viewer. This allowed users to view PDF contracts on the Evident website easily with a click of a button. In addition, it also included a signature component where users can sign and append the signature to the PDF document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really challenging at first, as I need to learn a new programming language, Vue, understand the flow of the digital contract, and create this digital contract component from scratch. Although it was difficult, I find communicating with my team really useful in terms of getting everyone on the same page and helping each other out when we faced issues or bugs. Which reduced a lot of friction when deploying the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business&quot;&gt;Business:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Business = Planning = Researching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on the Business side was completely different comparing it to the Engineering side. In Engineering everything was about the result, the execution and the output. On the other hand, business focuses more on the process, researching and planning. Although they follow different paths, they are heading toward the same destination – developing the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored many leading finance technology such as blockchain, wealth container and LPF. Taking it deeper dive at the current finance and technology world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really enjoyed working and being part of the Evident team, and special thanks to the COO of this company, Florian for sharing some of his personal experiences when it comes to starting and building a successful startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful time and gained a lot from this summer internship. I will definitely aim to build a tech startup that brings value to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remebered on my 42 Days Challenge blog, I set myself a target: to launch Cashrithm. But sadly that didn’t go as planned.😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-is-what-i-learned&quot;&gt;Here is what I learned&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-always-have-a-clear-plan&quot;&gt;1. Always have a clear plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, in the middle of the challenge I would change my tech stack because eiter I found a better tool or I decided it was too hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Stack I used for this challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firebase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node Express&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-research-research-research&quot;&gt;2. Research Research Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is extremely important especially when you are still new to this technology. See if you can find similar products from the open-source library or the internet in general and read their code. Not only will this save you time from debugging, but you can also learn from their code architect and see how you can make your program more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-break-tasks-into-smaller-more-manageble-tasks&quot;&gt;3. Break tasks into smaller more manageble tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split the work flow into daily checklists, make them small and accomplishable. Remember your goal is to build up momentum, not finishe everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;END&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really glad this challenge ended, from this challenge I learned a lot of new technology. Backend and frontend, but most importantly I achieved something instead of giving up. I will continue coding this project, and if you are interested check out my next month blog.😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;last-weekly-blog&quot;&gt;Last Weekly Blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my last weekly blog.😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain… The main reason why I decided to stop writing weekly blogs are because I need to prep for an upcoming exam. But also I’m getting bored of writing short paragraphs every week. I wouldn’t say my day-to-day life is interesting nor fun, it’s quite plain and repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m switching up the flow. I will be doing monthly blogs instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monthly-blogs&quot;&gt;Monthly Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized monthly blogs are great alternatives. Not only will there be more content for me to write and talk about, but also I get to document the full progress of my challenging and fun projects; as they normally will be completed over a month or two. But also, I’m lazy. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further a do, see you next month ~ August… 🍂🍂🍂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the final week and I haven’t explained the website thoroughly 😂. So this week I have decided to introduce the application I’ve been building for the last 38 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cashrithm&quot;&gt;Cashrithm&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cashrithm, a mix of &lt;strong&gt;Cash&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; aims to support and help small and medium entreprises to track their cashflow using pre-written algorithms. Aiming to provide an accurate data analysis and feedback to the user, reduce their time and effort to track their expenses, or revenue but focus more on their customer or product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Cashrithm is a simple website that provides a platform for users to upload their data in csv format, process data with pre-written algorithms and functions then provide an accurate summary of the data such as summing up the Revenue, categorize the Expense and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/home.png&quot; alt=&quot;home&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a minimal Dashboard that users will see after Login.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/add.png&quot; alt=&quot;add&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When you click on the plus button in the Dashboard page, it will direct you to the Add Data page which allow users to upload their csv files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/sheet.png&quot; alt=&quot;sheet&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When you click on the created data item it will direct you to a page that displays all the data, categories. Currently this page is still the first version, I will update the UX/UI of this page later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I create this website? To be honest this idea came from my mom’s friend. It may seem obvious as I have zero experience and knowledge in accountant and finance. But the main reason why I have decided to make this website from scratch is for &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I actually had the thought of earning a ton of money with this website, but as I started the coding journey the idea of earning money seemed a bit too far and stretched. So instead I took this challenge as a learning journey. I understood more in the backend side of the application such as database, user authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-6-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 6 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing new was added, but I made the application more scalable as I coded a few functions that could sum up the value, or categorize values when the functions are called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;function-algorithms-&quot;&gt;Function Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sum Algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category Algorithm based on Vender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As the deadline gets closer and closer, I can slowly feel the pressure. I’m blaming the pressure on the 42 days challenge I started. Not only do I have to keep the promise I made but also I really wanted to reach my milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was not fun at all, not only do I need to balance my school works but debugging takes forever to get debugged… (Someday when I have the capacity to hire someone, I will definetly hire a debugger. Hear me out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mvp&quot;&gt;MVP&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I want to introduce a new concept – MVP. MVP stands for &lt;strong&gt;minimum viable product&lt;/strong&gt;, not most valuable player. As a high school programmer and engineerer my connections are pretty limited, let’s be honest I only have less than 10 connections on Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, that is not the main point. The main point is if you are the general public, &lt;em&gt;cough cough&lt;/em&gt; me included, you and I will not care about the process, but the outcome, the final product and is it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as a 16 year old high schooler my resources are pretty limited. No experience, No team members (yes, I am a solo developer for now, if you want to help out please email me), No money. To sum it up, all I have is time and passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can I leverage my resources properly but also meet the market need (produce a product)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-list-out-all-the-must-have-features&quot;&gt;Step 1: List out all the must have features.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already have an idea in mind, I will recommend list out all the compulsory features. Make sure they are minimum, removing as many extra features, those aren’t that important for now because they can be added once your MVP is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:
In this project, one of the must-have feature is a database that could store user’s information and sheet information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-find-simple-open-source-tools&quot;&gt;Step 2: Find Simple Open-Source tools.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to make a chair there are 3 plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan A: You make the hammer by yourself by cutting down wood and finding a malleable rock. Then you use the hammer to build the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan B: You purchase the hammer, and use it to build the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan C: You purchase the chair. (But you don’t have enough money…)💸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linking that back to coding, Plan B seems to work the best out of the three. So instead of building everything from scratch, the hammer, you use tools that are made prior to your project. In my case Open-Source, there are many open-source materials in the internet decreasing your production time by half but they are also easy to use and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-test-run&quot;&gt;Step 3: Test Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before submitting your project, test run your application. Do a final checkup on every single funciton and detail, make sure everything runs smoothly, before launching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-5-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 5 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I tackled a few of the boring tasks. Debugging, debugging and debugging. Simple but boring. Will be adding more MVP features in the upcoming weeks, including csv file upload and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;removed-previous-errors-and-bugs-&quot;&gt;Removed previous errors and bugs ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The application can now add multiple sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link directly to the database, Firebase Firestore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;View data sheet by sheet id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this 7 days, I have been working and improving the design basically the user interface or user experience of my website. Although previously I’ve already designed the mockup, but after a bit of research and a bit of experimenting with the color schemes, I’ve decided to redo my design. It was a big commitment as I basically redo the whole entire website, which took me around 4+ hours to finish it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-design&quot;&gt;THE DESIGN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I bother to redesign and remake the website? Well, first of all layout and design of a product such as a website is extremenly important. Because many people including me &lt;strong&gt;judge a book by its cover&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s be realistic when people see an aesthetically pleasing website, they will definitely click on it and explore around rather than just close the tab and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don’t take art, nor a professional designer, but I have common sense. I basically used my instinct to determine whether this page looks good or needed a few changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talking…Here are a few screen shots of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/dataformater.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used neumorphic design to spice up the original mockups. I added a few shadows to the corners making the buttons look more 3D. Clean and minimal are my first priorities. This could help the users maneuver over the website smoothly, removing some friction and hopefully making the website look professional so people won’t notice a high schooler made this. But a ‘designer’ built this. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way if you are curious on how I landed this design, I actually did a few googling and testing on Adobe XD before comitting 3+ hours to actually style them on my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel free to comment below and give me some suggestions/advice on the design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-4-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 4 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, it is back on the server side coding. I will be focusing on writing functions. Hopefully it could simplify my existing code and makes the application more scalable for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uxui-design-&quot;&gt;UX/UI Design ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed a minimal web layout and implemented it to the actual website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Halfway through and 3 more weeks to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to say I have successfully launched a new feature. &lt;strong&gt;Categories algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;, this algorithm is the most difficult algorithm to code out of the other 2. I have been coding this particular section for a few weeks. Many times I was stucked in the infinie loop of bugs, but I am happy to announce the first version of Revenue, Expense, Categories algorithm is successfullly running. 👏👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;version-10-features&quot;&gt;Version 1.0 features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;layout&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
Version 1.0 is a bare bone framework and feature of Cashrithm. This will include 3 algorithms that sums up the data, categorize data based on Vender name and filter unecessary data value out based on the google sheet url which the user will input in a given input box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this version is not scalable as the algorithm is only limited to a few data sheet, and the run time is quite slow. In order to make my life simplier and easier in the future, I have decided to convert them into functions. A function for summing up all the value of a given column, a function that categorize value based on the Vender name and many more. In the future, if I wanted to add new algorithms, I can just simply add a few lines of code and Voila the algorithm is running. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my self-taught coding journey, I’ve learned that &lt;strong&gt;write once run anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; is a super important hack that could save me a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;version-11&quot;&gt;Version 1.1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/42days/summary.png&quot; alt=&quot;summary&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;
Since Version 1.0 is the bare bone skeleton of the structure of the program, Version 1.1 should be the fun stuff that gets implemented. I’m still confused by the numbering of the versions, some have 3 digits. I’ll just stick with 2 for now. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next 3 weeks, I will be working on version 1.1. Hopefully improving the user experience when they go on my website. But I will also fix some bugs I’ve been avoiding lately (mainly because debugging is a stressful and boring process, let’s hope in the future someone created a machine that could rewrite my code and make it bug-free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m extremely excited, and hopefully the outcome after 6 weeks could wow myself as this is big milestone for me, personally. 🎯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;progress-update-week-3-&quot;&gt;Progress Update: Week 3 📊&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will continue coding the input area where users can control what they want to see in the final summary sheet. On the other hand, I would convert all algorithms into functions that could be called easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;algorithms-&quot;&gt;Algorithms ✅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Category algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
