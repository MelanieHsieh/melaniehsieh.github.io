Hi, I'm Melanie Hsieh a highschooler who is passionate about tech. The reason
why I started this weekly blog is to share tips and tricks of me programming,
advocate other girls to engineering, technology, coding and most importantly
document my progress.

If you have any questions or feedbacks you can email me at <melanie@melaniehsieh.com>, feel free to find me on [Github](https://github.com/melaniehsieh) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/melaniehsieh)

See you on the upcoming blog ðŸ‘‹
