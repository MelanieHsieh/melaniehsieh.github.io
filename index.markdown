# In Short

The purpose of this weekly blog is to document my progress on building projects from scratch. And hopefully introduce others to technology, and inspire others to start their own projects.

# Why

I started this blog in 2020 when I was 16. Since 2018, I started to program small projects like simple websites for my friends, and a vocabulay slideshow powered by javascript. I began to develop a huge interest in all sorts of technology and engineering. I hope to use this platform to introduce girls to tech and engineering.
