# In Short

The purpose of this weekly blog is to document my progress on programming, starting a project from scratch and the ups and downs faced. And hopefully guide and inspire other people to start their own project.

# Why

I started this blog in 2020 when I was 16. Ever since 14, I started to program small projects like simple websites for my friends, and a vocabulay slideshow powered by javascript. I began to develop a huge interest in technology. Although in the beginning, the learning curve was huge but as the time progressed you will still face bugs that will make you feel impotent.

But after you debugged the code or show the project to other people the feeling is superb.ðŸ˜„
