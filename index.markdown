# In Short

The purpose of this weekly blog is to document my progress on programming. And hopefully guide and inspire other people to start their own projects.

# Why

I started this blog in 2020 when I was 16. Ever since 14, I started to program small projects like simple websites for my friends, and a vocabulay slideshow powered by javascript. I began to develop a huge interest in technology. Although in the beginning, the learning curve was huge but as time progressed I faced bugs that made me impotent, but when the code runs smoothly or when I show my project to somebody, I feel superb.
