# In Short

The purpose of this weekly blog is to document my progress on programming, starting a project from scratch and the ups and downs faced. And hopefully guide and inspire other people to start their own project.

# Why

I started this blog in 2020 when I was 16. Ever since 14, I started to program small projects like simple websites for my friends, and a vocabulay slideshow powered by javascript. I began to develop a huge interest in technology. Although in the beginning, the learning curve was huge but as time progressed you will still face bugs that makes you impotent. However when you debugged the code or show your project to someone the feeling is superb.
