I"Ê<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools ended early (but students still need to go to lessons online via Zoom). In April, starting this week, I have an Easter Break that lasts for 2 full weeks. Initially, it was meant to be a break so people can go outside and relax, but now everything seems to change. No one could go outside, go on vacations as most countries are in <em>lock-down mode</em>, hangout with friends. So the only option is to stay at home. During the break I continued on my project - Subtle, the Todo App.</p>

<h1 id="bugs">Bugs</h1>

<p>This morning I was going on Instagram, and I saw a post about <strong>Types of people during Quarantine</strong>. There are a few that caught my eye, such as <em>the introverts</em>, <em>the freelancers</em> and <em>the heros</em>. But then I thought about programmers/developers.</p>

<p>As a beginner programmer, the ONE THING that ruins my day is <strong>BUG(s)</strong>. They usually come in the color red, with a vague caption on the top that usually reads <strong>TypeError: Cannot read proprety â€˜xxxâ€™ of undefined</strong>. Let me show you how <strong>BUGS</strong> affect my daily mood. ğŸ˜ğŸ˜¡</p>

<ol>
  <li>ğŸ˜ - I run the code, it runs smoothly ğŸ‘(congrats)</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜ - I start to add new features</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜¡ - I run the code again and something red pops up.</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜¡ - I google the bug, look at my code and do some corrections</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜¡ - Continue <strong>Step 5 and 6</strong> over and over again until nothing red shows up, sometimes it might not be an error but the outcome isnâ€™t what I was expecting. On average it takes me 2 hours to debug one singe bug. (Quite time consumingâ€¦)</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜‘ - If I canâ€™t debug the code, I usually do something else (i.e. Eat lunch, sleep, watch YouTube)</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜ - Finally, I solved the bug</li>
  <li>ğŸ˜‘ - I repeat the steps all over again</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, my mood swings a lot. Quite drastically, from happy to mad, back to happy and back to mad. Often times I get demotivated as the code seems unsolvable. But I found a few tips and tricks to debug my code.</p>

<h1 id="5-ways-to-debug-your-code">5 Ways to Debug your code</h1>

<h3 id="1-use-consolelog">1. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code></h3>

<ul>
  <li>In javascript itâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log()</code>, in python itâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code>.</li>
  <li>It prints out the value of a variable youâ€™re declaring in the console</li>
  <li>It is an effective way to check your variables, methods, and function. Making sure they are working perfectly, if not it can also pinpoint the error.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-use-google">2. Use Google</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Many programming languages have existed for a decade or longer, many problems you faced were also faced by many people</li>
  <li>Websites such as Stack Overflow, Github, MDN web docs (if you are using javascript) are great ways to find solutions for your bug</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-go-on-youtube">3. Go on Youtube</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On Youtube, you can find videos that teaches you how to code from scratch</li>
  <li>You can reference some of their codes to your project</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-ask-a-friend">4. Ask a friend</h3>

<p>If you are like me who doesnâ€™t have friends that code, use online platforms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discord, join public servers and ask questions. Many people in the server are more experienced than you.</li>
  <li>Reddit, post your question on specific categories or just search for similar bugs and see the responses.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-sleep">5. Sleep</h3>

<p>Many times, I take breaks in between just to relax my brain cells (kinda). For me the best thing is just to take a break. Often times I think of alternative ways to solve the bug or even different ways to get the final results.</p>
