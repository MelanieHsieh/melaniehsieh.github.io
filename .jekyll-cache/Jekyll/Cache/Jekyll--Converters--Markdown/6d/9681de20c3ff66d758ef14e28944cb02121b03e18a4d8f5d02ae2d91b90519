I"H<p>Starting 2020 off with a bang 🎉, even though I’m late to the game for 3 months but whatever. The purpose of this weekly blog is simple, I want to share my tips and tricks on programming and some day to day experiences.</p>

<p>As this is the first time I tried blogging, it is still in experimenting phrase, which means this website will change often times.</p>

<h1 id="why">WHY</h1>

<p>As Melanie Hsieh once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every project must start with a <strong>Why</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I’m pretty sure someone famous said that, but since this is my blog I can say whatever I want. 😂)</p>

<p>My <strong>WHY</strong> is to inspire other girls to pursue engineering or tech, pursue might not be the word but introduce them to <em>The World of Technology</em>. The number of <em>Women in Tech</em> 👩‍💻️ is still low, and the future world defenitely need more engineers. So why not combine the two together?</p>

<p>And this is why <strong>Project Minimal</strong> is created. (I don’t even know how I came up with this name but someday sometime this name just poped up in my brain so I’m sticking with my gut.)</p>

<p>This is a minimal website which I decided to create to document my experiences in tech (coding/programming) and share my thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Establishing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#projectminimal</code> community, the main purpose is to inspire others to get into technology.</p>

<p>This blog gave you some insight on my weekly blog.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading 👀</p>
