I"><p>I have started many projects including a todo app, a weekly blog, an attendance app etc. However many of the projects were abandoned half-way through such as the todo app. Because I find it boring, or I couldnâ€™t move past the bugs. Then I stopped working on that project and pushing it back, like super back.</p>
