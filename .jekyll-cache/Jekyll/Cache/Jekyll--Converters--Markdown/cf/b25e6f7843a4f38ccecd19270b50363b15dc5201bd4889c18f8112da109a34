I".<p>More than <strong>10 million people</strong> worldwide are living with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. In simpler terms, many people suffered from Parkinsonâ€™s disease but it is not curable. <em>If deep brain stimulation (DBS) is mature enough then thereâ€™s a chance for PD to be curable.</em></p>

<p>By addressing this problem, I will be creating a tech device that could possibly help hospitals to offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.</p>

<h1 id="product">Product</h1>

<p>I built a wearable tech device to accurately capture patientâ€™s vibration value throughout the day. Tracking and analyzing recurring pattern that could help hospitals make better medication decisions for each patient.</p>

<p>Not only does it provide accurate data to hospitals, it also brings convieniences to PD patients when they revisit their doctors. Usually, patients will <strong>recall</strong> their past symptoms and ask doctor for further medication adjustment. However, it is difficult to recall every single detail, thus making the medication adjustment inaccurate, and inefficient.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESP8266 (wifi module)</li>
  <li>SW420 (vibration sensor)</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Jumper wires</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve decided to switch from Arduino Uno/Nano to ESP8266. The main reason is because it can post the data to the database without the need to connect the electronics with an usb cable.</p>

<h1 id="how">How?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>SW420 captures the vibration data from the user</li>
  <li>Save the time and vibration data to a database (Iâ€™m using Firebase)</li>
  <li>The website will get the data stored in the database</li>
  <li>Output a linear graph</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="demo">Demo</h1>

<h1 id="next">Nextâ€¦</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Use a ML model to analyze the dataset</li>
  <li>Identify certain time period that has the highest average vibration value</li>
  <li>Adding a battery so the electronic can go full <em>wireless</em></li>
  <li>User test</li>
</ol>
