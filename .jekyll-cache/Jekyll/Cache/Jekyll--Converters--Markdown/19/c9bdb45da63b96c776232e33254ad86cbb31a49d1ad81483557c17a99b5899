I"‰<p>Week 3. Halfway through and 3 more weeks to go!</p>

<p>I am delighted to say I have successfully launched a new feature. <strong>Categories algorithm</strong>, this algorithm is the most difficult algorithm to code out of the other 2. I have been coding this particular section for a few weeks. Many times I was stucked in the infinie loop of bugs, but I am happy to announce the first version of Revenue, Expense, Categories algorithm is successfullly running. ğŸ‘ğŸ‘</p>

<h1 id="version-10-features">Version 1.0 features</h1>

<p><img src="/img/42days/layout.png" alt="layout" width="700" />
Version 1.0 is a bare bone framework and feature of Cashrithm. This will include 3 algorithms that sums up the data, categorize data based on Vender name and filter unecessary data value out based on the google sheet url which the user will input in a given input box.</p>

<p>However, this version is not scalable as the algorithm is only limited to a few data sheet, and the run time is quite slow. In order to make my life simplier and easier in the future, I have decided to convert them into functions. A function for summing up all the value of a given column, a function that categorize value based on the Vender name and many more. In the future, if I wanted to add new algorithms, I can just simply add a few lines of code and Voila the algorithm is running. ğŸ‘</p>

<p>From my self-taught coding journey, Iâ€™ve learned that <strong>write once run anywhere</strong> is a super important hack that could save me a ton of time.</p>

<h1 id="version-11">Version 1.1</h1>

<p><img src="/img/42days/summary.png" alt="summary" width="700" />
Since Version 1.0 is the bare bone skeleton of the structure of the program, Version 1.1 should be the fun stuff that gets implemented. Iâ€™m still confused by the numbering of the versions, some have 3 digits. Iâ€™ll just stick with 2 for now. ğŸ˜‚</p>

<p>In the next 3 weeks, I will be working on version 1.1. Hopefully improving the user experience when they go on my website. But I will also fix some bugs Iâ€™ve been avoiding lately (mainly because debugging is a stressful and boring process, letâ€™s hope in the future someone created a machine that could rewrite my code and make it bug-free).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m extremely excited, and hopefully the outcome after 6 weeks could wow myself as this is big milestone for me, personally. ğŸ¯</p>

<h1 id="progress-update-week-3-">Progress Update: Week 3 ğŸ“Š</h1>

<p>Next week, I will continue coding the input area where users can control what they want to see in the final summary sheet. On the other hand, I would convert all algorithms into functions that could be called easily.</p>
