<p>To make life easier, I have drawn this curve to represent myself in different stages of this project. <strong>Yellow ball represents me, and Nung is the end goal.</strong></p>

<h3 id="1-the-motivation">1 The motivation</h3>

<p>In the first few days, the motivation was huge.</p>

<p>When I had the idea of helping PD patients on recieving better and more accurate medication, I was determined to do my best and become the change to launch this wearable tech device. My eye was on the final outcome â€“ Nung, this is why the ball is parallel to the end goal.</p>

<p>I can see and vision the goal, but to achieve it thereâ€™s a long way ahead.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-dip">2 The dip</h3>

<p>As I started to delve into all sorts of research research and research, I slowly realized there werenâ€™t any pre-existing product on this PD idea. Many ideas were on how to find or discover people with Parkinsonâ€™s Diease earlier. However, not much were being done in the process of having PD.
 googling on what others have done, experimenting with simple lines of code. I did countless of prototyping, tested with many different electronics and also wasted countless of hours debugging the code. I felt like I was being so unproductive, because I have been stuck on this issue or bug for 1 full month.</p>

<h3 id="3-rock-bottom">3 Rock bottom</h3>

<p>I was frustrated, and was defintely planning to give up.</p>

<p>But then, one day a City University engineering student replied to my debugging question, and for whatever reason, my program is working alongside the electronics. The sensor could send data straight to my computer.</p>

<p>I started to gain momentum, finished my Machine Learning algorithm. It was the closest I felt to the end goal, to actually building and launching Nung.</p>

<p>And I was right, after 4 months of pain, hard work, and countless of failures, I have finally finished <strong>Nung</strong>.</p>

<p>I have soldered the lithium polymer battery to my electronics, did a user test.</p>
