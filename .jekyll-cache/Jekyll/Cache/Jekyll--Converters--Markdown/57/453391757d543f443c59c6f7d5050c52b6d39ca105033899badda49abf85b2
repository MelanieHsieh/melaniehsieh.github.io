I"<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools ended early (but students still need to go to lessons online via Zoom). In April, starting this week, I have an Easter Break that lasts for 2 full weeks. Initially, it was meant to be a break so people can go outside and relax, but now everything seems to change. No one could go outside, go on vacations as most countries are in <em>lock-down mode</em>, hangout with friends. So the only option is to stay at home. During the break I continued on my project - Subtle, the Todo App.</p>
