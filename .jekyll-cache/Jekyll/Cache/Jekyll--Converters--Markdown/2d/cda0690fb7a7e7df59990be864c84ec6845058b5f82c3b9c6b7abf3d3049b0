I"N<p>This month I’ve been playing around with machine learning and experimenting with different libraries. On the other hand, I’ve been wanting to read this new Chinese novel series, 慶餘年. It has 760 chapters, each chapter with a few thousand Chinese character. Also, this novel series was highly recommended by my cousin.</p>
