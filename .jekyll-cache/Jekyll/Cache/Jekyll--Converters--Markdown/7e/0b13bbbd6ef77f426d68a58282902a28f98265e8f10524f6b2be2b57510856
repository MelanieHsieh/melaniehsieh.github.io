<p>The purpose of this monthly blog is to document my journey on building all sorts of useless but fun projects from scratch. Through my process of learning, coding, test-running and failing, I hope to introduce others to different fields and aspects of STEM.</p>

<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>I started this blog in 2020 when I was 16. Since 2018, I started to program small projects like simple websites for my friends, a vocabulay slideshow powered by javascript and many more. I began to develop a huge interest in technology and engineering. I hope to use this platform to introduce more girls to tech and engineering.</p>
