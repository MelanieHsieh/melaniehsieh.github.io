<p>About 6 weeks ago, I started the 42 Days Challenge, and now the challenge has ended.</p>

<p>I still remebered on my 42 Days Challenge blog, I set myself a target: to launch Cashrithm. But sadly that didnâ€™t go as planned.ğŸ˜¢</p>

<h1 id="here-is-what-i-learned">Here is what I learned</h1>

<h3 id="1-always-have-a-clear-plan">1. Always have a clear plan</h3>

<p>Often times, in the middle of the challenge I would change my tech stack because eiter I found a better tool or I decided it was too hard to implement.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Stack I used for this challenge:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Node Express</li>
  <li>Git Github</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-research-research-research">2. Research Research Research</h3>

<p>Research is extremely important especially when you are still new to this technology. See if you can find similar products from the open-source library or the internet in general and read their code. Not only will this save you time from debugging, but you can also learn from their code architect and see how you can make your program more efficient.</p>

<h3 id="3-break-tasks-into-smaller-more-manageble-tasks">3. Break tasks into smaller more manageble tasks</h3>

<p>Split the work flow into daily checklists, make them small and accomplishable. Remember your goal is to build up momentum, not finishe everything.</p>

<h3 id="end">END</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m really glad this challenge ended, from this challenge I learned a lot of new technology. Backend and frontend, but most importantly I achieved something instead of giving up. I will continue coding this project, and if you are interested check out my next month blog.ğŸ˜‰</p>

<h1 id="last-weekly-blog">Last Weekly Blog</h1>

<p>This will be my last weekly blog.ğŸ˜¢</p>

<p>Let me explainâ€¦ The main reason why I decided to stop writing weekly blogs are because I need to prep for an upcoming exam. But also Iâ€™m getting bored of writing short paragraphs every week. I wouldnâ€™t say my day-to-day life is interesting nor fun, itâ€™s quite plain and repetitive.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m switching up the flow. I will be doing monthly blogs instead.</p>

<h2 id="monthly-blogs">Monthly Blogs</h2>

<p>I realized monthly blogs are great alternatives. Not only will there be more content for me to write and talk about, but also I get to document the full progress of my challenging and fun projects; as they normally will be completed over a month or two. But also, Iâ€™m lazy. ğŸ˜‚</p>

<p>Without further a do, see you next month ~ Augustâ€¦ ğŸ‚ğŸ‚ğŸ‚</p>

<p>Please subscibe to my monthly blog to get the latest updates.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading ğŸ‘€. There will be a monthly blog every month on the first week of Friday, Stay Tuned.ğŸ˜‰</p>
