I"'<p>In <em>Decemeber 31st, 2019</em> I thought 2020 is going to be a good start.</p>

<p><strong>Number ONE:</strong> It‚Äôs a new decade. <strong>2020</strong> means new goals, new commitment and most importantly, new ME. It‚Äôs a year where I want to improve myself <em>exponentially</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Number TWO:</strong> I turned 16. üéÇüéâ</p>

<p><strong>Number THREE:</strong> I have a list of projects I want to achieve and build this year. (You can find them on my <em>Project Page</em>)</p>

<h1 id="covid-19-in-hong-kong">Covid-19 in Hong Kong</h1>

<p>As I am currently living in Hong Kong. Since the spread of COVID-19 near the end of January, more than 100 countries are infected. This made all the schools closed and holiday extension. I am not complaninig about the extra few days of holidays, but not able to go outside freely sucks.</p>

<p>Many schools including mine has started online school with tools like zoom, google hangout just to name a few. At first, I felt overwhelmed of all the homework and assignment piling up. Especially my exam in May is coming soon, teachers gave us extra work to catchup. It was very tiring and made me feel <strong>SchoolSick</strong>. (I know it may sound weird)</p>

<h1 id="staying-at-home">Staying at Home</h1>

<p>Due to the outbreak, we had to stay at home. Usually on Saturdays and Sundays I go to church and join some extra activies to fill up my time. But now all of them are cancelled üò¢.</p>

<p>Below are some methods I tried over the <em>stay-at-home</em> period.</p>

<p>I decided to start a project to fill in the time. I am currently making an app, (if you are interested check out the next blog.) It doesn‚Äôt have to be a big project, it could be something small e.g. finish this Netflix show, bake something, draw‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Every Saturday evening, I hangout with my friends in church with <em>zoom or skype</em> just to check in with each other. It is a great way to relax and just socialize.</p>

<p>Remember to wear a mask when you are going outside. It is very important especially these days, as the corona virus is deadly ü¶†.</p>
