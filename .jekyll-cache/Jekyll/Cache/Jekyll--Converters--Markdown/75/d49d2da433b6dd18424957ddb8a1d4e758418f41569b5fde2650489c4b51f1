I"€<p>One of the project this year is to make a Todo App. If you search <em>todo app</em> in the app store or play store there are a lot of options. However I tried a few of them, and often they are either too complicated to use, or they are just missing some functions I want. So this upcoming month, I am planning to launch my Todo App called <strong>Subtle</strong> from scratch.</p>
