I"–	<p>More than <strong>10 million people</strong> worldwide are living with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. Basically in simpler terms, Parkinsonâ€™s disease is not curable but many patients have been suffering from it worldwide.</p>

<p>By addressing this crucial problem, I would like to propose a tech device that could help hospitals offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.</p>

<h1 id="wearable-tech-device">Wearable tech device</h1>

<p>I built a wearable tech device to accurately capture patientâ€™s vibration value throughout the day. Tracking and analyzing recurring pattern that could help hospitals make better medication decisions for each patient.</p>

<p>Not only does it provide accurate data to hospitals, it also brings convieniences to PD patients when they revisit their doctors. Usually, patients will <strong>recall</strong> their past symptoms and ask doctor for further medication adjustment. However, it is difficult to recall every single detail, thus making the medication adjustment inaccurate, and inefficient.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESP8266 (wifi module)</li>
  <li>SW420 (vibration sensor)</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Jumper wires</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Iâ€™ve decided to switch from Arduino Uno/Nano to ESP8266. The main reason is because it can post the data to the database without the need to connect the electronics with an usb cable.</p>

<h1 id="how">How?</h1>
<ol>
  <li>SW420 captures the vibration datation data from the user. Save the vibration data and time to a database. The website will then get the data stored in the database and output a linear graph.</li>
</ol>
