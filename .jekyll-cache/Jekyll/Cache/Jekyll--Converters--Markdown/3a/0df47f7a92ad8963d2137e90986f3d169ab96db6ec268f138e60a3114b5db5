I"Í<p>Week Number Two.</p>

<p>Today is Day 10 of my challenge, to be honest it has been tough since school started and homeworks have been piling up. ğŸ˜µ I didnâ€™t achieve as much as I intended to, sort of struggling between balancing school and personal projects. But still glad to see my friends again.</p>

<p>Basically, this weekâ€™s progress was bad. On a scale from 1 - 10, I will say it is a solid 3.</p>

<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>

<p>From the very beginning I have always aimed for consistency. But after these 10 Days, things have gotten harder and harder. More bugs, less motivation, more homework (worst thing ever, canâ€™t believe they still exist). Needless to say, this week was stressful and daunting.</p>

<p>Even with these troublesome problems, I am glad that I still managed to keep my streak of crosses running. Although somedays I only did a short 10 minutes programming session but I kept myself accountable and didnâ€™t give up. ğŸ‘ğŸ‘</p>

<p>Although it is way easier to give up then to continue, but I just want to have a complete product. <strong>Just One Single Complete Project</strong>. Although erros and bugs are unavoidable but having a clear purpose forced me or even kicked me to continue working on this project.</p>

<p>This website might not be used by anyone, but completeing a project means a lot to me. So have a strong clear purpose, a purpose that will someday push or kick you when you feel low and stressful.</p>

<h3 id="1-category-algorithm">1. Category algorithm</h3>

<p>It is a bit more complicated than the other 2 algorithms because it consists of two data source instead of one. I have been pushing this feature back for a while so I hope to finish this as soon as possible so it wonâ€™t delay my schedule. (not saying that I have a busy schedule.)</p>

<h3 id="2-input-sheet">2. Input Sheet</h3>

<p>I will add more features on the Create New Sheet page. I want to allow users to control the data-output so it is tailor-made. Not only that, but have a friendly user interface. (probably adding that near the end, when every main components are working together) ğŸ¤</p>

<p>Finally finished one of the key features which is the algorithm section that fetches data and return a summary of it.</p>
