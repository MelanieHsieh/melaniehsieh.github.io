I"Ó	<p>More than <strong>10 million people</strong> worldwide are living with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). A progressive nervous system disorder that causes stiffness and affects the movement of the patient. Basically in simpler terms, Parkinsonâ€™s disease is not curable but many patients have been suffering from it worldwide.</p>

<p>By addressing this crucial problem, I would like to propose a tech device that could help hospitals offer PD patients more accurate and pratical medications.</p>

<h1 id="wearable-tech-device">Wearable tech device</h1>

<p>I built a wearable tech device to accurately capture patientâ€™s vibration value throughout the day. Tracking and analyzing recurring pattern that could help hospitals make better medication decisions for each patient.</p>

<p>Not only does it provide accurate data to hospitals, it also brings convieniences to PD patients when they revisit their doctors. Usually, patients will <strong>recall</strong> their past symptoms and ask doctor for further medication adjustment. However, it is difficult to recall every single detail, thus making the medication adjustment inaccurate, and inefficient.</p>

<p>This is my first ever project that connects both hardware and software together. Primarilly, Iâ€™ll be using an Arduino Uno to send the data to my computer server which will be running a program that draws a line graph live.</p>

  <li>SW-420 (vibration sensor)</li>
  <li>Jumper wires</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>SW-420</strong> will capture the vibration data from the user. Based on the time of the day, it will show different number of the vibration.</p>
