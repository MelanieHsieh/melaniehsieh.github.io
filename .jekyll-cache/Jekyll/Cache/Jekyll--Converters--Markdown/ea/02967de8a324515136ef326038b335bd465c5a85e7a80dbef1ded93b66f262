I"‡	<p>I am starting a new series! Yes, no more code snippets or tutorials. (Well only for a while.) I realized most of my readers arenâ€™t interested in coding so I decided to change up the content. I am goingÂ to tell stories about myself.</p>

<h1 id="primary-school">Primary School</h1>

<p>Exactly 10 years ago, I started primary school. Back then, my favorite subjects were Art and ICT (basically computer class). Mainly because there werenâ€™t any tests and exams. To clarify Iâ€™m not the kid with straight Aâ€™s, or the kid whoâ€™s talented in sports. But I am the kid who hated exams and tests especially dictations.</p>

<h3 id="art-class">Art class</h3>

<p>I like art because it was fun. I remembered once I made a cardboard robot with red pockets with my friends. I enjoyed the process of making something physical from start to finish.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything is Art</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw a youtube video explaining how someone put a blank white painting in an art gallery and sold it for millions of dollars. So I thought it would be easy to score an A, as there are a lot of empty white pages in my sketchbook. Well expectations never equal to reality. I learned that from the hard way.</p>

<p>In reality my art grades were Câ€™s.</p>

<h2 id="computer-class">Computer class</h2>

<p>In the beginning, I hated computer classes. They were so boring and repetive, each lesson teachers just explain some basic functions of the computer such as what is copy and paste.</p>

<p>But, as we started to learn scratch I started to build up my curiosity on writing simple block codes. It was extremely fun as I could basically control the cat, what it does, where it goes. Later on I participated in competitions to enhance my skills. I even won a few awards.</p>

<p>The awards I got might be small comparing them to other peopleâ€™s. But these small achievements sparked joy, because someone verified my product, they think itâ€™s good. Now thatâ€™s something big.</p>
