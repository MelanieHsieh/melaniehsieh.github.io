I"ê<p>As Melanie Hsieh once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Big things must start from small things, and small things are usually simple things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Thatâ€™s a lot of â€œthingsâ€ repeated in the same quote. ğŸ˜‚)</p>

<p>In the first year of Middle School, I saw a friend of mine coding. When I looked at his computer, I was blowned away. From my primary school experiences I thought coding was just block codes, with a cat hovering on a screen. But he was writing script codes. He was coding in simple HTML and a bit of CSS. This was my first experience in actual real coding. ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ’»ï¸</p>

<p>That sparked my curiosity in understanding and exploring tech and coding more in depth. I was getting serious abount this hobby. ğŸ˜</p>

<h1 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h1>

<p>Around November, our school hosted a Hackathon. Hackathon is basically a 2-day event where students participate this event to get exposure to different coding possivility and a 1-day build day where we present our business ideas to judges about our product.</p>

<p>Back then I just started pure, simple HTML. I only know how to add headings, text and simple styling to my website. Basically <strong>zero</strong> experience in coding.</p>

<h1 id="day-1-workshop">Day 1: Workshop</h1>

<p>It was a Friday and I forced two of my friends to join me in this Hackathon. The only reason why they joined this event wasnâ€™t because they are interested in coding but because we get to skip school.</p>

<p><img src="/img/hackathon/esf.jpg" alt="esf" /></p>

<p>Every big event starts with a speech. It was kinda long to be honest, one hour (I have short patience span). But after the boring bit, the fun part begins â€“ <strong>the workshop</strong>.</p>

<p>We got to choose 6 workshops to participate over the course, hosted by different coding organizations in Hong Kong. Ranging from simple tutorials on creating a web or app, to making a game from scratch. It didnâ€™t go in depth as every session only took an hour, but thereâ€™s one workshop that blew my mind ğŸ¤¯, it was a tutorial on making an app with Javascript.</p>

<p>It was a pokemon app, (yes, back then pokemon go was still a big trend) that simply shows images of pokemons when you tap the screen. I didnâ€™t learn much from this workshop session as everything is still brand new to me, but it made me feel cooler than I was before. When I showed my app to my friends, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Because I know how to code and they donâ€™t.</p>

<p>At that time, I would consider myself as a <strong>nerd</strong> ğŸ¤“ (I think I still am). I enjoyed everything related to tech. So I find this new hobby, coding extremely suitable to my interest.</p>

<h1 id="day-2-coding-time-ï¸">Day 2: Coding time ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ’»ï¸</h1>

<p>In groups of 4, we started our actual <strong>Hackathon</strong>. We came up with a business idea and started to work on it. Someone is responisible on the presentation, someone is responsible on the app design, and someone is responisble on the marketing side.</p>

<p>Not knowing anything related to marketing and economics/business, my main focus was the marketing side. I made a simple website to promote our business idea, which was a platform that allows users to share items between each other. Spare the details cause I simply canâ€™t remember any of them.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s talk about the website, it was the first website Iâ€™ve ever made. ğŸ‘ It was a blue background web page that has 2 sentences explaining our business idea, and a huge section introducing members of our team, and a <strong>Terms and Condition Section</strong> made up on the spot by my friend Gemma.</p>

<p>Things never go the way as we planned, and during the hackathon we faced a lot of problems. Especially as a beginner, with zero experience and knowledge. There were times where we got distracted in Papaâ€™s Pizzeria, there were times where we have no clue what we were doing, and there were times where we were demotivated when other teams got a better product, a more professional website than our team. But I still enjoyed the process on working with different people, and comes up with a business idea in one single day.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In the end, surprisingly we won an award on best idea. Each of us won a gift voucher for a free course from one of the coding org. But after this event, I gained a lot more insights on tech, especially when I realized that coding is much wider and deeper than I thought originially.</p>

<p>In the future, I will build up my skills on coding and join more competitve Hackathons where teams have to come up with a product and a plan in a certain amount of time period. Most importantly, have better prizes other than vouchers that is only limited to their company.</p>
