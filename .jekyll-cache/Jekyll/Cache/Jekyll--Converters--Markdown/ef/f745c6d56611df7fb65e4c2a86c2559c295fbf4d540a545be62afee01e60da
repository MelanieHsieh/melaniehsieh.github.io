I"a<p>It’s now Week 5, time flew by and I only have less than 2 weeks to launch version 1 of <strong>Cashrithm</strong>. As the deadline gets closer and closer, I can slowly feel the pressure. I’m blaming the pressure on the 42 days challenge I started. Not only do I have to keep the promise I made but also I really wanted to reach my milestone.</p>
