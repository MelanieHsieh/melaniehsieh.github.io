<p>Machine learning has gain massive popularity in the last few decades. Many popular applications uses machine learning to help companies do things that couldnâ€™t be done before. For example, Netflixâ€™s movie recommendation, Emailâ€™s spam identifier, Siriâ€™s virtual personal assitants. This also include hospitals use ML to identify lung cancer using image recognition.</p>

<p>ML is mainly seperated into 2 groups â€“ Classification and Regression.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Classification</strong> predicts a discrete class label. For example identifying if the given image is a dog or a cat.</li>
  <li><strong>Regression</strong> on the other hand predicts a continuous quantity. For example predicting house prices given a certain location.</li>
</ul>

<p>Linear Regression is the simplest regression model. It uses the equation of a straight line <code> y = a + bx + e </code> to map out the data set and identifies the line of best fit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>y : the dependent variable (output)</li>
  <li>x : the independent variable (input)</li>
  <li>a : the y-intercept</li>
  <li>b : the gradient or slope</li>
  <li>e : the error rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Polynomial Regression is another regression model, similar to linear regression but predicts the curve of best fit. The general equation is <code> y = a + b1x + b2x^2 +....+ bnx^n </code>, in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. The higher the nth degree, the more accurate the curve will be corresponding to its datapoints.</p>

<p>For this project, Iâ€™ve decided to use <strong>Polynomial Regression model</strong> to identify the userâ€™s greatest average vibration value from different time period. Reason being my datapoints do not show an obvious correlation between the x and y-axis, polnomial fits wider range of curvature and more accurate prediction. However, they are very sensitive to outliers, if there are one or two anomaly datapoints, it will affect the result of the graph.</p>

<p>Another important feature that ML needs is <strong>data</strong>. In order to have a precise and accurate prediction, they need many many training and testing data.</p>

<p>I have drew this simple diagram out to visualize what Iâ€™m planning to do with my input datasets (the vibration value Iâ€™ve collected with the Nung device).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use polynomial regression model to draw a near-accurate curve</li>
  <li>Identify the max-points of the graph</li>
  <li>Find the coordinates of the max point <strong>(time, vibration_value)</strong></li>
</ol>
